# This program is inspired by https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html

# The A* Search works by incorporating both the distance from the starting point
# and the distance from the target in its heurisitic.

# It tends to find the correct (shortest) path even when the Greedy Best-First Search does not,
# and it explores less of the grid, and is therefore faster, than Dijkstra's Search.
