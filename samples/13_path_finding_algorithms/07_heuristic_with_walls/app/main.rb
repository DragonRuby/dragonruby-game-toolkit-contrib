# This program is inspired by https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html

# This time the heuristic search still explored less of the grid, hence finishing faster.
# However, it did not find the shortest path between the star and the target.

# The only difference between this app and Heuristic is the change of the starting position.
