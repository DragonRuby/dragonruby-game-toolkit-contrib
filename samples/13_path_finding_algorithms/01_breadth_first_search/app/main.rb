# A visual demonstration of a breadth first search
# Inspired by https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html

# An animation that can respond to user input in real time

# A breadth first search expands in all directions one step at a time
# The frontier is a queue of cells to be expanded from
# The visited hash allows quick lookups of cells that have been expanded from
# The walls hash allows quick lookup of whether a cell is a wall

# The breadth first search starts by adding the red star to the frontier array
# and marking it as visited
# Each step a cell is removed from the front of the frontier array (queue)
# Unless the neighbor is a wall or visited, it is added to the frontier array
# The neighbor is then marked as visited

# The frontier is blue
# Visited cells are light brown
# Walls are camo green
# Even when walls are visited, they will maintain their wall color

# The star can be moved by clicking and dragging
# Walls can be added and removed by clicking and dragging
