# Comparison of a breadth first search with and without early exit
# Inspired by https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html

# Demonstrates the exploration difference caused by early exit
# Also demonstrates how breadth first search is used for path generation

# The left grid is a breadth first search without early exit
# The right grid is a breadth first search with early exit
# The red squares represent how far the search expanded
# The darker the red, the farther the search proceeded
# Comparison of the heat map reveals how much searching can be saved by early exit
# The white path shows path generation via breadth first search
