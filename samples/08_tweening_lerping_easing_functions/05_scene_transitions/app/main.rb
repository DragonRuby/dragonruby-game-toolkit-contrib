# This sample app shows a more advanced implementation of scenes:
# 1. "Scene 1" has a label on it that says "I am scene ONE. Press enter to go to scene TWO."
# 2. "Scene 2" has a label on it that says "I am scene TWO. Press enter to go to scene ONE."
# 3. When the game starts, Scene 1 is presented.
# 4. When the player presses enter, the scene transitions to Scene 2 (fades out Scene 1 over half a second, then fades in Scene 2 over half a second).
# 5. When the player presses enter again, the scene transitions to Scene 1 (fades out Scene 2 over half a second, then fades in Scene 1 over half a second).
# 6. During the fade transitions, spamming the enter key is ignored (scenes don't accept a transition/respond to the enter key until the current transition is completed).
