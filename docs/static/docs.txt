* Getting Started

This is a tutorial written by Ryan C Gordon (a Juggernaut in the industry who has contracted to Valve,
Epic, Activision, and EA... check out his Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_C._Gordon).

** Introduction

Welcome!

Here's just a little push to get you started if you're new to programming or game development.

If you want to write a game, it's no different than writing any other program for any other framework: there are a few simple rules that might be new to you, but more or less programming is programming no matter what you are building.

Did you not know that? Did you think you couldn't write a game because you're a "web guy" or you're writing Java at a desk job? Stop letting people tell you that you can't, because you already have everything you need.

Here, we're going to be programming in a language called "Ruby." In the interest of full disclosure, I (Ryan Gordon) wrote the C parts of this toolkit and Ruby looks a little strange to me (Amir Rajan wrote the Ruby parts, discounting the parts I mangled), but I'm going to walk you through the basics because we're all learning together, and if you mostly think of yourself as someone that writes C (or C++, C#, Objective-C), PHP, or Java, then you're only a step behind me right now.

** Prerequisites

Here's the most important thing you should know: Ruby lets you do some complicated things really easily, and you can learn that stuff later. I'm going to show you one or two cool tricks, but that's all.

Do you know what an if statement is? A for-loop? An array? That's all you'll need to start.

** The Game Loop

Ok, here are few rules with regards to game development with GTK:

- Your game is all going to happen under one function ...
- that runs 60 times a second ...
- and has to tell the computer what to draw each time.

That's an entire video game in one run-on sentence.

Here's that function. You're going to want to put this in mygame/app/main.rb, because that's where we'll look for it by default. Load it up in your favorite text editor.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.labels << [580, 400, 'Hello World!']
  end
#+end_src

Now run dragonruby ...did you get a window with "Hello World!" written in it? Good, you're officially a game developer!

** Breakdown Of The tick Method

~mygame/app/main.rb~, is where the Ruby source code is located. This looks a little strange, so I'll break it down line by line. In Ruby, a '#' character starts a single-line comment, so I'll talk about this inline.

#+begin_src ruby
  # This "def"ines a function, named "tick," which takes a single argument
  # named "args". DragonRuby looks for this function and calls it every
  # frame, 60 times a second. "args" is a magic structure with lots of
  # information in it. You can set variables in there for your own game state,
  # and every frame it will updated if keys are pressed, joysticks moved,
  # mice clicked, etc.
  def tick args
  
    # One of the things in "args" is the "outputs" object that your game uses
    # to draw things. Afraid of rendering APIs? No problem. In DragonRuby,
    # you use arrays to draw things and we figure out the details.
    # If you want to draw text on the screen, you give it an array (the thing
    # in the [ brackets ]), with an X and Y coordinate and the text to draw.
    # The "<<" thing says "append this array onto the list of them at
    # args.outputs.labels)
    args.outputs.labels << [580, 400, 'Hello World!']
  end
#+end_src

Once your ~tick~ function finishes, we look at all the arrays you made and figure out how to draw it. You don't need to know about graphics APIs. You're just setting up some arrays! DragonRuby clears out these arrays every frame, so you just need to add what you need _right now_ each time.

** Rendering A Sprite

Now let's spice this up a little.

We're going to add some graphics. Each 2D image in DragonRuby is called a "sprite," and to use them, you just make sure they exist in a reasonable file format (png, jpg, gif, bmp, etc) and specify them by filename. The first time you use one, DragonRuby will load it and keep it in video memory for fast access in the future. If you use a filename that doesn't exist, you get a fun checkerboard pattern!

There's a "dragonruby.png" file included, just to get you started. Let's have it draw every frame with our text:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.labels  << [580, 400, 'Hello World!']
    args.outputs.sprites << [576, 100, 128, 101, 'dragonruby.png']
  end
#+end_src

NOTE:

 Pro Tip: you don't have to restart DragonRuby to test your changes; when you save main.rb, DragonRuby will notice and reload your program.

That ~.sprites~ line says "add a sprite to the list of sprites we're drawing, and draw it at position (576, 100) at a size of 128x101 pixels". You can find the image to draw at dragonruby.png.

** Coordinate System and Virtual Canvas

Quick note about coordinates: (0, 0) is the bottom left corner of the screen, and positive numbers go up and to the right. This is more "geometrically correct," even if it's not how you remember doing 2D graphics, but we chose this for a simpler reason: when you're making Super Mario Brothers and you want Mario to jump, you should be able to add to Mario's y position as he goes up and subtract as he falls. It makes things easier to understand.

Also: your game screen is _always_ 1280x720 pixels. If you resize the window, we will scale and letterbox everything appropriately, so you never have to worry about different resolutions.

Ok, now we have an image on the screen, let's animate it:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.rotation  ||= 0
    args.outputs.labels  << [580, 400, 'Hello World!' ]
    args.outputs.sprites << [576, 100, 128, 101, 'dragonruby.png', args.state.rotation]
    args.state.rotation  -= 1
  end
#+end_src

Now you can see that this function is getting called a lot!

** Game State

Here's a fun Ruby thing: ~args.state.rotation ||= 0~ is shorthand for "if args.state.rotation isn't initialized, set it to zero." It's a nice way to embed your initialization code right next to where you need the variable.

~args.state~ is a place you can hang your own data. It's an open data structure that allows you to define properties that are arbitrarily nested. You don't need to define any kind of class.

In this case, the current rotation of our sprite, which is happily spinning at 60 frames per second. If you don't specify rotation (or alpha, or color modulation, or a source rectangle, etc), DragonRuby picks a reasonable default, and the array is ordered by the most likely things you need to tell us: position, size, name.

** There Is No Delta Time

One thing we decided to do in DragonRuby is not make you worry about delta time: your function runs at 60 frames per second (about 16 milliseconds) and that's that. Having to worry about framerate is something massive triple-AAA games do, but for fun little 2D games? You'd have to work really hard to not hit 60fps. All your drawing is happening on a GPU designed to run Fortnite quickly; it can definitely handle this.

Since we didn't make you worry about delta time, you can just move the rotation by 1 every time and it works without you having to keep track of time and math. Want it to move faster? Subtract 2.

** Handling User Input

Now, let's move that image around.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.rotation ||= 0
    args.state.x ||= 576
    args.state.y ||= 100
  
    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      args.state.x = args.inputs.mouse.click.point.x - 64
      args.state.y = args.inputs.mouse.click.point.y - 50
    end
  
    args.outputs.labels  << [580, 400, 'Hello World!']
    args.outputs.sprites << [args.state.x,
                             args.state.y,
                             128,
                             101,
                             'dragonruby.png',
                             args.state.rotation]
  
    args.state.rotation -= 1
  end
#+end_src

Everywhere you click your mouse, the image moves there. We set a default location for it with ~args.state.x ||= 576~, and then we change those variables when we see the mouse button in action. You can get at the keyboard and game controllers in similar ways.

** Coding On A Raspberry Pi

We have only tested DragonRuby on a Raspberry Pi 3, Models B and B+, but we believe it _should_ work on any model with comparable specs.

If you're running DragonRuby Game Toolkit on a Raspberry Pi, or trying to run a game made with the Toolkit on a Raspberry Pi, and it's really really slow-- like one frame every few seconds--then there's likely a simple fix.

You're probably running a desktop environment: menus, apps, web browsers, etc. This is okay! Launch the terminal app and type:

#+begin_src bash
  do raspi-config
#+end_src

It'll ask you for your password (if you don't know, try "raspberry"), and then give you a menu of options. Find your way to "Advanced Options", then "GL Driver", and change this to "GL (Full KMS)" ... not "fake KMS," which is also listed there. Save and reboot. In theory, this should fix the problem.

If you're _still_ having problems and have a Raspberry Pi 2 or better, go back to raspi-config and head over to "Advanced Options", "Memory split," and give the GPU 256 megabytes. You might be able to avoid this for simple games, as this takes RAM away from the system and reserves it for graphics. You can also try 128 megabytes as a gentler option.

Note that you can also run DragonRuby without X11 at all: if you run it from a virtual terminal it will render fullscreen and won't need the "Full KMS" option. This might be attractive if you want to use it as a game console sort of thing, or develop over ssh, or launch it from RetroPie, etc.

** Conclusion

There is a lot more you can do with DragonRuby, but now you've already got just about everything you need to make a simple game. After all, even the most fancy games are just creating objects and moving them around. Experiment a little. Add a few more things and have them interact in small ways. Want something to go away? Just don't add it to ~args.output~ anymore.
* Starting a New DragonRuby Project

The DragonRuby zip that contains the engine is a complete, self contained project
structure. To create a new project, unzip the zip file again in its entirety
and use that as a starting point for another game. This is the recommended
approach to starting a new project.

NOTE:

 It's strongly recommended that you do NOT keep DragonRuby Game Toolkit in a shared location and
instead unzip a clean copy for every game (and commit everything to source control). 
 

File access functions are sandoxed and assume that the ~dragonruby~ binary lives alongside
the game you are building. Do not expect file access functions to return correct values if you are attempting
to run the ~dragonruby~ binary from a shared location. It's recommended that the directory
structure contained in the zip is not altered and games are built using that starting directory structure.

** Public Repos

*** Option 1 (Recommended)

Your public repository needs only to contain the contents of ~./mygame~. This approach
is the cleanest and doesn't require your ~.gitignore~ to be polluted with DragonRuby
specific files.

*** Option 2 (Restrictions Apply)

NOTE:

 Do NOT commit ~dragonruby-publish(.exe)~, or ~dragonruby-bind(.exe)~.

#+begin_src 
  dragonruby
  dragonruby.exe
  dragonruby-publish
  dragonruby-publish.exe
  dragonruby-bind
  dragonruby-bind.exe
  /tmp/
  /builds/
  /logs/
  /samples/
  /docs/
  /.dragonruby/
#+end_src

If you'd like people who do not own a DragonRuby license to run your game, you may include
the ~dragonruby(.exe)~ binary within the repo. This permission is granted in good-faith
and can be revoked if abused.

** Private Repos / Commercial Games

The following ~.gitignore~ should be used for private repositories (commercial games).

#+begin_src 
  /tmp/
  /logs/
#+end_src
You'll notice that everything else is committed to source control (even the ~./samples~, ~./docs~, and ~./builds~ directory).

NOTE:

 The DragonRuby binary/package is designed to be committed in its entirety
with your source code (it’s why we keep it small). This protects the “shelf life”
for commercial games. 3 years from now, we might be on a vastly different version
of the engine. But you know that the code you’ve written will definitely work with the
version that was committed to source control.
* Deploying To Itch.io

NOTE:

 It's strongly recommended that you do NOT keep DragonRuby Game Toolkit in a shared location and
instead unzip a clean copy for every game (and commit everything to source control). 
 

File access functions are sandoxed and assume that the ~dragonruby~ binary lives alongside
the game you are building. Do not expect file access functions to return correct values if you are attempting
to run the ~dragonruby~ binary from a shared location. It's recommended that the directory
structure contained in the zip is not altered and games are built using that starting directory structure.

Once you've built your game, you're all set to deploy! Good luck in
your game dev journey and if you get stuck, come to the Discord
channel!

** Creating Your Game Landing Page

Log into Itch.io and go to <https://itch.io/game/new>.

-   Title: Give your game a Title. This value represents your \~gametitle\~.
-   Project URL: Set your project url. This value represents your \~gameid\~.
-   Classification: Keep this as Game.
-   Kind of Project: Select HTML from the drop down list. Don't worry,
    the HTML project type <span class="underline">also supports binary downloads</span>.
-   Uploads: Skip this section for now.

You can fill out all the other options later.

** Update Your Game's Metadata

Point your text editor at ~mygame/metadata/game_metadata.txt~ and
make it look like this:

NOTE: Remove the ~#~ at the beginning of each line.

#+begin_src txt
  devid=bob
  devtitle=Bob The Game Developer
  gameid=mygame
  gametitle=My Game
  version=0.1
#+end_src

The ~devid~ property is the username you use to log into Itch.io.
The ~devtitle~ is your name or company name (it can contain spaces).
The ~gameid~ is the Project URL value.
The ~gametitle~ is the name of your game (it can contain spaces).
The ~version~ can be any ~major.minor~ number format.

** Building Your Game For Distribution

Open up the terminal and run this from the command line:

#+begin_src sh
  ./dragonruby-publish --package mygame
#+end_src

NOTE:

 If you're on Windows, don't put the "./" on the front. That's a Mac and
Linux thing.

A directory called ~./build~ will be created that contains your
binaries. You can upload this to Itch.io manually.

*** Browser Game Settings

For the HTML version of your game, the following configuration is required for your game to run correctly:

-   Check the checkbox labeled ~This file will be played in the browser~ for the html version of your game (it's one of the zip files you'll upload).
-   Ensure that ~Embed options -> SharedArrayBuffer support~ is checked.
-   Be sure to set the ~Viewport dimensions~ to ~1280x720~ for landscape games or your game will not be positioned correctly on your Itch.io page.
-   Be sure to set the ~Viewport dimensions~ to ~540x960~ for portrait games or your game will not be positioned correctly on your Itch.io page.

For subsequent updates you can use an automated deployment to Itch.io:

#+begin_src sh
  ./dragonruby-publish mygame
#+end_src

DragonRuby will package <span class="underline">and publish</span> your game to itch.io! Tell your
friends to go to your game's very own webpage and buy it!

If you make changes to your game, just re-run dragonruby-publish and it'll
update the downloads for you.

*** Consider Adding Pause When Game is In Background

It's a good idea to pause the game if it doesn't have focus. Here's an example of how to do that

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # if the keyboard doesn't have focus, and the game is in production mode, and it isn't the first tick
    if (!args.inputs.keyboard.has_focus &&
        args.gtk.production &&
        Kernel.tick_count != 0)
      args.outputs.background_color = [0, 0, 0]
      args.outputs.labels << { x: 640,
                               y: 360,
                               text: "Game Paused (click to resume).",
                               alignment_enum: 1,
                               r: 255, g: 255, b: 255 }
      # consider setting all audio volume to 0.0
    else
      # perform your regular tick function
    end
  end
#+end_src

If you want your game to run at full speed even when it's in the background, add the following line to ~mygame/metadata/cvars.txt~:

    renderer.background_sleep=0

*** Consider Adding a Request to Review Your Game In-Game

Getting reviews of your game are extremely important and it's recommended that you put an option to review
within the game itself. You can use ~args.gtk.openurl~ plus a review URL. Here's an example:
#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # render the review button
    args.state.review_button ||= { x:    640 - 50,
                                   y:    360 - 25,
                                   w:    100,
                                   h:    50,
                                   path: :pixel,
                                   r:    0,
                                   g:    0,
                                   b:    0 }
    args.outputs.sprites << args.state.review_button
    args.outputs.labels << { x: 640,
                             y: 360,
                             anchor_x: 0.5,
                             anchor_y: 0.5,
                             text: "Review" }
  
    # check to see if the review button was clicked
    if args.inputs.mouse.intersect_rect? args.state.review_button
      # open platform specific review urls
      if args.gtk.platform? :ios
        # your app id is provided at Apple's Developer Portal (numeric value)
        args.gtk.openurl "itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/app/idYOURGAMEID?action=write-review"
      elsif args.gtk.platform? :android
        # your app id is the name of your android package
        args.gtk.openurl "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=YOURGAMEID"
      elsif args.gtk.platform? :web
        # if they are playing the web version of the game, take them to the purchase page on itch
        args.gtk.openurl "https://amirrajan.itch.io/YOURGAMEID/purchase"
      else
        # if they are playing the desktop version of the game, take them to itch's rating page
        args.gtk.openurl "https://amirrajan.itch.io/YOURGAMEID/rate?source=game"
      end
    end
  end
#+end_src
* Deploying To Mobile Devices

NOTE:

 It's strongly recommended that you do NOT keep DragonRuby Game Toolkit in a shared location and
instead unzip a clean copy for every game (and commit everything to source control). 
 

File access functions are sandoxed and assume that the ~dragonruby~ binary lives alongside
the game you are building. Do not expect file access functions to return correct values if you are attempting
to run the ~dragonruby~ binary from a shared location. It's recommended that the directory
structure contained in the zip is not altered and games are built using that starting directory structure.

If you have a Pro subscription, you also have the capability to deploy
to mobile devices.

** Deploying to iOS

To deploy to iOS, you need to have a Mac running MacOS Catalina, an
iOS device, and an active/paid Developer Account with Apple. From the
Console type: ~$wizards.ios.start~ and you will be guided through the
deployment process.

- ~$wizards.ios.start env: :dev~ will deploy to an iOS device connected via USB.
- ~$wizards.ios.start env: :hotload~ will deploy to an iOS device connected via USB with hotload enabled.
- ~$wizards.ios.start env: :sim~ will deploy to the iOS simulator.
- ~$wizards.ios.start env: :prod~ will package your game for distribution via Apple's AppStore.

** Deploying to Android

To deploy to Android, you need to have an Android emulator/device, and
an environment that is able to run Android SDK. ~dragonruby-publish~
will create an APK for you. From there, you can sign the APK and
install it to your device. The signing and installation procedure
varies from OS to OS. Here's an example of what the command might look
like:

NOTE:

 Be sure you specify ~packageid=TLD.YOURCOMPANY.YOURGAME~ (reverse domain name convention) within ~metadata/game_metadata.txt~ before running ~dragonruby-publish~ (for example: ~packageid=com.tempuri.mygame~).

#+begin_src sh
  # generating a keystore (one time creation, save key to ./profiles for safe keeping)
  keytool -genkey -v -keystore APP.keystore -alias mygame -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
  
  # signing binaries
  apksigner sign --min-sdk-version 26 --ks ./profiles/APP.keystore ./builds/APP-android.apk
  apksigner sign --min-sdk-version 26 --ks ./profiles/APP.keystore ./builds/APP-googleplay.aab
  
  # Deploying APK to a local device/emulator
  adb install ./builds/APP-android.apk
  
  # Deploying Google Play APK to a local device/emulator
  bundletool build-apks --bundle=./builds/APP-googleplay.aab --output=./builds/app.apks --mode=universal
  mv ./builds/app.apks ./builds/app.zip
  cd ./builds
  rm -rf tmp
  mkdir tmp
  cd tmp
  unzip ../app.zip
  cp ./universal.apk ./universal.zip
  unzip ./universal.zip
  
  # uninstall, install, launch
  adb shell am force-stop PACKAGEID
  adb uninstall PACKAGEID
  adb install ./universal.apk
  adb shell am start -n PACKAGEID/PACKAGEID.DragonRubyActivity
  
  # read logs of device
  adb logcat -e mygame
#+end_src

* DragonRuby's Philosophy

The following tenants of DragonRuby are what set us apart from other game engines. Given that Game Toolkit is a relatively new engine, there are definitely features that are missing. So having a big check list of "all the cool things" is not this engine's forte. This is compensated with a strong commitment to the following principles.

** Challenge The Status Quo
Game engines of today are in a local maximum and don't take into consideration the challenges of this day and age. Unity and GameMaker specifically rot your brain. It's not sufficient to say:

But that's how we've always done it.

It's a hard pill to swallow, but forget blindly accepted best practices and try to figure out the underlying motivation for a specific approach to game development. Collaborate with us.

** Continuity of Design
There is a programming idiom in software called "The Pit of Success". The term normalizes upfront pain as a necessity/requirement in the hopes that the investment will yield dividends "when you become successful" or "when the code becomes more complicated". This approach to development is strongly discouraged by us. It leads to over-architected and unnecessary code; creates barriers to rapid prototyping and shipping a game; and overwhelms beginners who are new to the engine or programming in general.

DragonRuby's philosophy is to provide multiple options across the "make it fast" vs "make it right" spectrum, with incremental/intuitive transitions between the options provided. A concrete example of this philosophy would be render primitives: the spectrum of options allows renderable constructs that take the form of tuples/arrays (easy to pickup, simple, and fast to code/prototype with), hashes (a little more work, but gives you the ability to add additional properties), open and strict entities (more work than hashes, but yields cleaner apis), and finally - if you really need full power/flexibility in rendering - classes (which take the most amount of code and programming knowledge to create).

** Release Early and Often
The biggest mistake game devs make is spending too much time in isolation building their game. Release something, however small, and release it soon.

Stop worrying about everything being pixel perfect. Don't wait until your game is 100% complete. Build your game publicly and iterate. Post in the #show-and-tell channel in the community Discord. You'll find a lot of support and encouragement there.

Real artists ship. Remember that.

** Sustainable And Ethical Monetization

We all aspire to put food on the table doing what we love. Whether it is building games, writing tools to support game development, or anything in between.

Charge a fair amount of money for the things you create. It's expected and encouraged within the community. Give what you create away for free to those that can't afford it.

If you are gainfully employed, pay full price for the things you use. If you do end up getting something at a discount, pay the difference "forward" to someone else.

** Sustainable And Ethical Open Source

This goes hand in hand with sustainable and ethical monetization. The current state of open source is not sustainable. There is an immense amount of contributor burnout. Users of open source expect everything to be free, and few give back. This is a problem we want to fix (we're still trying to figure out the best solution).

So, don't be "that guy" in the Discord that says "DragonRuby should be free and open source!" You will be personally flogged by Amir.

** People Over Entities

We prioritize the endorsement of real people over faceless entities. This game engine, and other products we create, are not insignificant line items of a large company. And you aren't a generic "commodity" or "corporate resource". So be active in the community Discord and you'll reap the benefits as more devs use DragonRuby.

** Building A Game Should Be Fun And Bring Happiness

We will prioritize the removal of pain. The aesthetics of Ruby make it such a joy to work with, and we want to capture that within the engine.

** Real World Application Drives Features

We are bombarded by marketing speak day in and day out. We don't do that here. There are things that are really great in the engine, and things that need a lot of work. Collaborate with us so we can help you reach your goals. Ask for features you actually need as opposed to anything speculative.

We want DragonRuby to -actually- help you build the game you want to build (as opposed to sell you something piece of demoware that doesn't work).

 NOTE: From an official branding standpoint each one of the products is suffixed with "A DragonRuby LLP Product" tagline. Also, DragonRuby is _one word, title cased_.

NOTE:

 NOTE: We leave the "A DragonRuby LLP Product" off of this one because that just sounds really weird.

NOTE:

 NOTE: Devs who use DragonRuby are "Dragon Riders/Riders of Dragons". That's a bad ass identifier huh?

*** What is DragonRuby?

The response to this question requires a few subparts. First we need to clarify some terms. Specifically _language specification_ vs _runtime_.

--Okay... so what is the difference between a language specification and a runtime?--

A runtime is an _implementation_ of a language specification. When people say "Ruby," they are usually referring to "the Ruby 3.0+ language specification implemented via the CRuby/MRI Runtime."

But, there are many Ruby Runtimes: CRuby/MRI, JRuby, Truffle, Rubinius, Artichoke, and (last but certainly not least) DragonRuby.

--Okay... what language specification does DragonRuby use then?--

DragonRuby's goal is to be compliant with the ISO/IEC 30170:2012 standard. It's syntax is Ruby 2.x compatible, but also contains semantic changes that help it natively interface with platform specific libraries.

--So... why another runtime?--

The elevator pitch is:

DragonRuby is a Multilevel Cross-platform Runtime. The "multiple levels" within the runtime allows us to target platforms no other Ruby can target: PC, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, WASM, iOS, Android, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox, and Stadia.

*** What does Multilevel Cross-platform mean?

There are complexities associated with targeting all the platforms we support. Because of this, the runtime had to be architected in such a way that new platforms could be easily added (which lead to us partitioning the runtime internally):

- Level 1 we leverage a good portion of mRuby.
- Level 2 consists of optimizations to mRuby we've made given that our target platforms are well known.
- Level 3 consists of portable C libraries and their Ruby C-Extensions.

Levels 1 through 3 are fairly commonplace in many runtime implementations (with level 1 being the most portable, and level 3 being the fastest). But the DragonRuby Runtime has taken things a bit further:

- Level 4 consists of shared abstractions around hardware I/O and operating system resources. This level leverages open source and proprietary components within Simple DirectMedia Layer (a low level multimedia component library that has been in active development for 22 years and counting).
- Level 5 is a code generation layer which creates metadata that allows for native interoperability with host runtime libraries. It also includes OS specific message pump orchestrations.
- Level 6 is a Ahead of Time/Just in Time Ruby compiler built with LLVM. This compiler outputs _very_ fast platform specific bitcode, but only supports a subset of the Ruby language specification.

These levels allow us to stay up to date with open source implementations of Ruby; provide fast, native code execution on proprietary platforms; ensure good separation between these two worlds; and provides a means to add new platforms without going insane.

--Cool cool. So given that I understand everything to this point, can we answer the original question? What is DragonRuby?--

DragonRuby is a Ruby runtime implementation that takes all the lessons we've learned from MRI/CRuby, and merges it with the latest and greatest compiler and OSS technologies.

*** How is DragonRuby different than MRI?

DragonRuby supports a subset of MRI apis. Our target is to support all of mRuby's standard lib. There are challenges to this given the number of platforms we are trying to support (specifically console).

*** Does DragonRuby support Gems?

DragonRuby does not support gems because that requires the installation of MRI Ruby on the developer's machine (which is a non-starter given that we want DragonRuby to be a zero dependency runtime). While this seems easy for Mac and Linux, it is much harder on Windows and Raspberry Pi. mRuby has taken the approach of having a git repository for compatible gems and we will most likely follow suite: https://github.com/mruby/mgem-list.

*** Does DragonRuby have a REPL/IRB?

You can use DragonRuby's Console within the game to inspect object and execute small pieces of code. For more complex pieces of code create a file called repl.rb and put it in mygame/app/repl.rb:

Any code you write in there will be executed when you change the file. You can organize different pieces of code using the repl method:

#+begin_src ruby
  repl do
    puts "hello world"
    puts 1 + 1
  end
#+end_src

If you use the ~repl~ method, the code will be executed and the DragonRuby Console will automatically open so you can see the results (on Mac and Linux, the results will also be printed to the terminal).
All puts statements will also be saved to logs/puts.txt. So if you want to stay in your editor and not look at the terminal, or the DragonRuby Console, you can tail this file.
4. To ignore code in repl.rb, instead of commenting it out, prefix repl with the letter x and it'll be ignored.

#+begin_src ruby
  xrepl do # <------- line is prefixed with an "x"
    puts "hello world"
    puts 1 + 1
  end
  
  # This code will be executed when you save the file.
  repl do
    puts "Hello"
  end
  
  repl do
    puts "This code will also be executed."
  end
  
  # use xrepl to "comment out" code
  xrepl do
    puts "This code will not be executed because of the x in front of repl".
  end
#+end_src

*** Does DragonRuby support pry or have any other debugging facilities?

~pry~ is a gem that assumes you are using the MRI Runtime (which is incompatible with DragonRuby). Eventually DragonRuby will have a pry based experience that is compatible with a debugging infrastructure called LLDB. Take the time to read about LLDB as it shows the challenges in creating something that is compatible.

You can use DragonRuby's replay capabilities to troubleshoot:

DragonRuby is hot loaded which gives you a very fast feedback loop (if the game throws an exception, it's because of the code you just added).
Use ~./dragonruby mygame --record~ to create a game play recording that you can use to find the exception (you can replay a recording by executing ~./dragonruby mygame --replay last_replay.txt~ or through the DragonRuby Console using ~$gtk.recording.start_replay "last_replay.txt"~.

DragonRuby also ships with a unit testing facility. You can invoke the following command to run a test: ~./dragonruby mygame --test tests/some_ruby_file.rb~.
Get into the habit of adding debugging facilities within the game itself. You can add drawing primitives to ~args.outputs.debug~ that will render on top of your game but will be ignored in a production release.

Debugging something that runs at 60fps is (imo) not that helpful. The exception you are seeing could have been because of a change that occurred many frames ago.


** Frequent Comments About Ruby as a Language Choice

*** But Ruby is dead.

Let's check the official source for the answer to this question: [isrubydead.com](https://isrubydead.com/).

On a more serious note, Ruby's _quantity_ levels aren't what they used to be. And that's totally fine. Everyone chases the new and shiny.

What really matters is _quality/maturity_. Here's a StackOverflow Survey sorted by highest paid developers: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-top-paying-technologies-top-paying-technologies.

Let's stop making this comment shall we?

*** But Ruby is slow.

That doesn't make any sense. A language specification can't be slow... it's a language spec. Sure, an _implementation/runtime_ can be slow though, but then we'd have to talk about which runtime.

Here are some quick demonstrations of how well DragonRuby Game Toolkit Performs:

- DragonRuby vs Unity: https://youtu.be/MFR-dvsllA4
- DragonRuby vs PyGame: https://youtu.be/fuRGs6j6fPQ

*** Dynamic languages are slow.

They are certainly slower than statically compiled languages. With the processing power and compiler optimizations we have today, dynamic languages like Ruby are _fast enough_.

Unless you are writing in some form of intermediate representation by hand, your language of choice also suffers this same fallacy of slow. Like, nothing is faster than a low level assembly-like language. So unless you're writing in that, let's stop making this comment.

NOTE:

 NOTE: If you _are_ hand writing LLVM IR, we are always open to bringing on new partners with such a skill set. Email us ^_^.

** Frequent Concerns

*** DragonRuby is not open source. That's not right.

The current state of open source is unsustainable. Contributors work for free, most all open source repositories are severely under-staffed, and burnout from core members is rampant.

We believe in open source very strongly. Parts of DragonRuby are in fact, open source. Just not all of it (for legal reasons, and because the IP we've created has value). And we promise that we are looking for (or creating) ways to _sustainably_ open source everything we do.

If you have ideas on how we can do this, email us!

If the reason above isn't sufficient, then definitely use something else.

All this being said, we do have parts of the engine open sourced on GitHub: https://github.com/dragonruby/dragonruby-game-toolkit-contrib/

*** DragonRuby is for pay. You should offer a free version.

If you can afford to pay for DragonRuby, you should (and will). We don't tell authors that they should give us their books for free, and only require payment if we read the entire thing. It's time we stop asking that of software products.

That being said, we will _never_ put someone out financially. We have income assistance for anyone that can't afford a license to any one of our products.

You qualify for a free, unrestricted license to DragonRuby products if any of the following items pertain to you:

- Your income is below $2,000.00 (USD) per month.
- You are under 18 years of age.
- You are a student of any type: traditional public school, home schooling, college, bootcamp, or online.
- You are a teacher, mentor, or parent who wants to teach a kid how to code.
- You work/worked in public service or at a charitable organization: for example public office, army, or any 501(c)(3) organization.

Just contact Amir at amir.rajan@dragonruby.org with a short explanation of your current situation and he'll set you up. No questions asked.

--But still, you should offer a free version. So I can try it out and see if I like it.--

You can try our web-based sandbox environment at http://fiddle.dragonruby.org. But it won't do the runtime justice. Or just come to our Discord Channel at http://discord.dragonruby.org and ask questions. We'd be happy to have a one on one video chat with you and show off all the cool stuff we're doing.

Seriously just buy it. Get a refund if you don't like it. We make it stupid easy to do so.

--I still think you should do a free version. Think of all people who would give it a shot.--

Free isn't a sustainable financial model. We don't want to spam your email. We don't want to collect usage data off of you either. We just want to provide quality toolchains to quality developers (as opposed to a large quantity of developers).

The people that pay for DragonRuby and make an effort to understand it are the ones we want to build a community around, partner with, and collaborate with. So having that small monetary wall deters entitled individuals that don't value the same things we do.

*** What if I build something with DragonRuby, but DragonRuby LLP becomes insolvent.

We want to be able to work on the stuff we love, every day of our lives. And we'll go to great lengths to make that continues.

But, in the event that sad day comes, our partnership bylaws state that _all_ DragonRuby IP that can be legally open sourced, will be released under a permissive license.

** Troubleshoot Performance

- Avoid deep recursive calls.
- If you're using ~Array~s for your primitives (~args.outputs.sprites << []~), use ~Hash~ instead (~args.outputs.sprites << { x: ... }~).
- If you're using ~Entity~ for your primitives (~args.outputs.sprites << args.state.new_entity~), use ~StrictEntity~ instead (~args.outputs.sprites << args.state.new_entity_strict~).
- Use ~.each~ instead of ~.map~ if you don't care about the return value.
- When concatenating primitives to outputs, do them in bulk. Instead of:
#+begin_src ruby
  args.state.bullets.each do |bullet|
    args.outputs.sprites << bullet.sprite
  end
#+end_src
do
#+begin_src
  args.outputs.sprites << args.state.bullets.map do |b|
    b.sprite
  end
#+end_src
- Use ~args.outputs.static_~ variant for things that don't change often (take a look at the Basic Gorillas sample app and Dueling Starships sample app to see how ~static_~ is leveraged.
- Consider using a ~render_target~ if you're doing some form of a camera that moves a lot of primitives (take a look at the Render Target sample apps for more info).
- Avoid deleting or adding to an array during iteration. Instead of:
#+begin_src ruby
  args.state.fx_queue.each |fx|
    fx.count_down ||= 255
    fx.countdown -= 5
    if fx.countdown < 0
      args.state.fx_queue.delete fx
    end
  end
#+end_src
Do:
#+begin_src ruby
  args.state.fx_queue.each |fx|
    fx.countdown ||= 255
    fx.countdown -= 5
  end

  args.state.fx_queue.reject! { |fx| fx.countdown < 0 }
#+end_src

* RECIPIES:
** How To Determine What Frame You Are On

There is a property on ~state~ called ~tick_count~ that is incremented
by DragonRuby every time the ~tick~ method is called. The following
code renders a label that displays the current ~tick_count~.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.labels << [10, 670, "\#{Kernel.tick_count}"]
  end
#+end_src

** How To Get Current Framerate

Current framerate is a top level property on the Game Toolkit Runtime
and is accessible via ~args.gtk.current_framerate~.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.labels << [10, 710, "framerate: \#{args.gtk.current_framerate.round}"]
  end
#+end_src

** How To Render A Sprite Using An Array

All file paths should use the forward slash ~/~ *not* backslash
~\~. Game Toolkit includes a number of sprites in the ~sprites~
folder (everything about your game is located in the ~mygame~ directory).

The following code renders a sprite with a ~width~ and ~height~ of
~100~ in the center of the screen.

~args.outputs.sprites~ is used to render a sprite.

NOTE: Rendering using an ~Array~ is "quick and dirty". It's generally recommended that
      you render using ~Hashes~ long term.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.sprites << [
      640 - 50,                 # X
      360 - 50,                 # Y
      100,                      # W
      100,                      # H
      'sprites/square-blue.png' # PATH
   ]
  end
#+end_src

** Rendering a Sprite Using a ~Hash~

Using ordinal positioning can get a little unruly given so many
properties you have control over.

You can represent a sprite as a ~Hash~:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 640 - 50,
      y: 360 - 50,
      w: 100,
      h: 100,

      path: 'sprites/square-blue.png',
      angle: 0,

      a: 255,
      r: 255,
      g: 255,
      b: 255,

      # source_ properties have origin of bottom left
      source_x:  0,
      source_y:  0,
      source_w: -1,
      source_h: -1,

      # tile_ properties have origin of top left
      tile_x:  0,
      tile_y:  0,
      tile_w: -1,
      tile_h: -1,

      flip_vertically: false,
      flip_horizontally: false,

      angle_anchor_x: 0.5,
      angle_anchor_y: 1.0,

      blendmode_enum: 1

      # sprites anchor/alignment (default is nil)
      anchor_x: 0.5,
      anchor_y: 0.5
    }
  end
#+end_src

The ~blendmode_enum~ value can be set to ~0~ (no blending), ~1~ (alpha blending),
~2~ (additive blending), ~3~ (modulo blending), ~4~ (multiply blending).

** How To Render A Label

~args.outputs.labels~ is used to render labels.

Labels are how you display text. This code will go directly inside of
the ~def tick args~ method.

NOTE: Rendering using an ~Array~ is "quick and dirty". It's generally recommended that
      you render using ~Hashes~ long term.

Here is the minimum code:

#+begin_src
  def tick args
    #                       X    Y    TEXT
    args.outputs.labels << [640, 360, "I am a black label."]
  end
#+end_src

** A Colored Label

#+begin_src
  def tick args
    # A colored label
    #                       X    Y    TEXT,                   RED    GREEN  BLUE  ALPHA
    args.outputs.labels << [640, 360, "I am a redish label.", 255,     128,  128,   255]
  end
#+end_src

** Extended Label Properties

#+begin_src
  def tick args
    # A colored label
    #                       X    Y     TEXT           SIZE  ALIGNMENT  RED  GREEN  BLUE  ALPHA  FONT FILE
    args.outputs.labels << [
      640,                   # X
      360,                   # Y
      "Hello world",         # TEXT
      0,                     # SIZE_ENUM
      1,                     # ALIGNMENT_ENUM
      0,                     # RED
      0,                     # GREEN
      0,                     # BLUE
      255,                   # ALPHA
      "fonts/coolfont.ttf"   # FONT
    ]
  end
#+end_src

A ~SIZE_ENUM~ of ~0~ represents "default size". A ~negative~ value
will decrease the label size. A ~positive~ value will increase the
label's size.

An ~ALIGNMENT_ENUM~ of ~0~ represents "left aligned". ~1~ represents
"center aligned". ~2~ represents "right aligned".

** Rendering A Label As A ~Hash~

You can add additional metadata about your game within a label, which requires you to use a `Hash` instead.

If you use a ~Hash~ to render a label, you can set the label's size using either ~SIZE_ENUM~ or ~SIZE_PX~. If
both options are provided, ~SIZE_PX~ will be used.

#+begin_src
  def tick args
    args.outputs.labels << {
      x:                       200,
      y:                       550,
      text:                    "dragonruby",
      # size specification can be either size_enum or size_px
      size_enum:               2,
      size_px:                 22,
      alignment_enum:          1,
      r:                       155,
      g:                       50,
      b:                       50,
      a:                       255,
      font:                    "fonts/manaspc.ttf",
      vertical_alignment_enum: 0, # 0 is bottom, 1 is middle, 2 is top
      anchor_x: 0.5,
      anchor_y: 0.5
      # You can add any properties you like (this will be ignored/won't cause errors)
      game_data_one:  "Something",
      game_data_two: {
         value_1: "value",
         value_2: "value two",
         a_number: 15
      }
    }
  end
#+end_src

** Getting The Size Of A Piece Of Text

You can get the render size of any string using ~args.gtk.calcstringbox~.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    #                             TEXT           SIZE_ENUM  FONT
    w, h = args.gtk.calcstringbox("some string",         0, "font.ttf")

    # NOTE: The SIZE_ENUM and FONT are optional arguments.

    # Render a label showing the w and h of the text:
    args.outputs.labels << [
      10,
      710,
      # This string uses Ruby's string interpolation literal: #{}
      "'some string' has width: #{w}, and height: #{h}."
    ]
  end
#+end_src

** Rendering Labels With New Line Characters And Wrapping

You can use a strategy like the following to create multiple labels from a String.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    long_string = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elitteger dolor velit, ultricies vitae libero vel, aliquam imperdiet enim."
    max_character_length = 30
    long_strings_split = args.string.wrapped_lines long_string, max_character_length
    args.outputs.labels << long_strings_split.map_with_index do |s, i|
      { x: 10, y: 600 - (i * 20), text: s }
    end
  end
#+end_src

** How To Play A Sound

Sounds that end ~.wav~ will play once:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # Play a sound every second
    if (Kernel.tick_count % 60) == 0
      args.outputs.sounds << 'something.wav'
    end
  end
#+end_src

Sounds that end ~.ogg~ is considered background music and will loop:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # Start a sound loop at the beginning of the game
    if Kernel.tick_count == 0
      args.outputs.sounds << 'background_music.ogg'
    end
  end
#+end_src

If you want to play a ~.ogg~ once as if it were a sound effect, you can do:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # Play a sound every second
    if (Kernel.tick_count % 60) == 0
      args.gtk.queue_sound 'some-ogg.ogg'
    end
  end
#+end_src

** Using ~args.state~ To Store Your Game State

~args.state~ is a open data structure that allows you to define
properties that are arbitrarily nested. You don't need to define any kind of
~class~.

To initialize your game state, use the ~||=~ operator. Any value on
the right side of ~||=~ will only be assigned _once_.

To assign a value every frame, just use the ~=~ operator, but _make
sure_ you've initialized a default value.

#+begin_src
  def tick args
    # initialize your game state ONCE
    args.state.player.x  ||= 0
    args.state.player.y  ||= 0
    args.state.player.hp ||= 100

    # increment the x position of the character by one every frame
    args.state.player.x += 1

    # Render a sprite with a label above the sprite
    args.outputs.sprites << [
      args.state.player.x,
      args.state.player.y,
      32, 32,
      "player.png"
    ]

    args.outputs.labels << [
      args.state.player.x,
      args.state.player.y - 50,
      args.state.player.hp
    ]
  end
#+end_src

** Accessing files

DragonRuby uses a sandboxed filesystem which will automatically read from and
write to a location appropriate for your platform so you don't have to worry
about theses details in your code. You can just use ~gtk.read_file~,
~gtk.write_file~, and ~gtk.append_file~ with a relative path and the engine
will take care of the rest.

The data directories that will be written to in a production build are:

- Windows: ~C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\[devtitle]\[gametitle]~
- MacOS: ~$HOME/Library/Application Support/[gametitle]~
- Linux: ~$HOME/.local/share/[gametitle]~
- HTML5: The data will be written to the browser's IndexedDB.

The values in square brackets are the values you set in your
~app/metadata/game_metadata.txt~ file.

When reading files, the engine will first look in the game's data directory
and then in the game directory itself. This means that if you write a file
to the data directory that already exists in your game directory, the file
in the data directory will be used instead of the one that is in your game.

When running a development build you will directly write to your game
directory (and thus overwrite existing files). This can be useful for built-in
development tools like level editors.

For more details on the implementation of the sandboxed filesystem, see Ryan
C. Gordon's PhysicsFS documentation: [[https://icculus.org/physfs/]]

IMPORTANT: File access functions are sandoxed and assume that the
~dragonruby~ binary lives alongside the game you are building. Do not
expect file access functions to return correct values if you are attempting
to run the ~dragonruby~ binary from a shared location. It's
recommended that the directory structure contained in the zip is not
altered and games are built using that starter template.

* Outputs (~args.outputs~)

Outputs is how you render primitives to the screen. The minimal setup for
rendering something to the screen is via a ~tick~ method defined in
mygame/app/main.rb

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.solids     << { x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100 }
    args.outputs.sprites    << { x: 100, y: 100, w: 100, h: 100, path: "sprites/square/blue.png" }
    args.outputs.labels     << { x: 200, y: 200, text: "Hello World" }
    args.outputs.borders    << { x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100 }
    args.outputs.lines      << { x: 300, y: 300, x2: 400, y2: 400 }
  end
#+end_src

** Collection Render Orders

Primitives are rendered first-in, first-out. The rendering order (sorted by bottom-most to top-most):

- ~solids~
- ~sprites~
- ~primitives~: Accepts all render primitives. Useful when you want to bypass the default rendering orders for rendering (eg. rendering solids on top of sprites).
- ~labels~
- ~lines~
- ~borders~
- ~debug~: Accepts all render primitives. Use this to render primitives for debugging (production builds of your game will not render this layer).

** ~primitives~

~args.outputs.primitives~ can take in any primitive and will render first in, first out.

For example, you can render a ~solid~ above a ~sprite~:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # sprite
    args.outputs.primitives << { x: 100, y: 100,
                                 w: 100, h: 100,
                                 path: "sprites/square/blue.png" }
  
    # solid
    args.outputs.primitives << { x: 0,
                                 y: 0,
                                 w: 100,
                                 h: 100,
                                 primitive_marker: :solid }
  
    # border
    args.outputs.primitives << { x: 0,
                                 y: 0,
                                 w: 100,
                                 h: 100,
                                 primitive_marker: :border }
  
    # label
    args.outputs.primitives << { x: 100, y: 100,
                                 text: "hello world" }
  
    # line
    args.outputs.primitives << { x: 100, y: 100, x2: 150, y2: 150 }
  end
#+end_src

** ~debug~

~args.outputs.debug~ will not render in production mode and behaves like ~args.outputs.primitives~. Objects in this collection
are rendered above everything.

*** String Primitives

Additionally, ~args.outputs.debug~ allows you to pass in a ~String~ as a primitive type. This is helpful for quickly showing the
value of a variable on the screen. A label with black text and a white background will be created for each ~String~ sent in. The
labels will be automatically stacked vertically for you. New lines in the string will be respected.

Example:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.player ||= { x: 100, y: 100 }
    args.state.player.x += 1
    args.state.player.x = 0 if args.state.player.x > 1280
  
    # the following string values will generate labels with backgrounds
    # and will auto stack vertically
    args.outputs.debug << "current tick: #{Kernel.tick_count}"
    args.outputs.debug << "player x: #{args.state.player.x}"
    args.outputs.debug << "hello\nworld"
  end
#+end_src

*** ~watch~

If you need additional control over a string value, you can use the ~args.outputs.debug.watch~ function.

The functions takes in the following parameters:

- Object to watch. This object will be converted to a string.
- The ~label_style~: optional, named argument can be passed in with a ~Hash~ to override the default label style for watch variables.
- The ~background_style~: optional named argument can be passed in with a ~Hash~ to override the default background style for the watch variables.

Example:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.player ||= { x: 100, y: 100 }
    args.state.player.x += 1
    args.state.player.x = 0 if args.state.player.x > 1280
  
    args.outputs.debug.watch args.state.player
    args.outputs.debug.watch pretty_format(args.state.player),
                             label_style: { r: 0,
                                            g: 0,
                                            b: 255,
                                            size_px: 10 },
                             background_style: { r: 0,
                                                 g: 255,
                                                 b: 0,
                                                 a: 128,
                                                 path: :solid }
  end
#+end_src

** ~solids~

Add primitives to this collection to render a solid to the screen.

NOTE:

 This render primitive is fine to use sparingly. If you find
yourself rendering a large number of solids, render ~sprites~ instead
(the textures that solid primitives generate are not cached and do not
perform as well as rendering sprites).

For example, the following ~solid~ and ~sprite~ are equivalent:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.solids << {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      w: 100,
      h: 100,
      r: 255,
      g: 255,
      b: 255,
      a: 128
    }
  
    # is equivalent to
  
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      w: 100,
      h: 100,
      path: :solid,
      r: 255,
      g: 255,
      b: 255,
      a: 128
    }
  end
#+end_src

*** Array Render Primitive

Creates a solid black rectangle located at 100, 100. 160 pixels
wide and 90 pixels tall.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    #                         X    Y  WIDTH  HEIGHT
    args.outputs.solids << [100, 100,   160,     90]
  end
#+end_src

NOTE:

 ~Array~-based primitives are find for debugging purposes/quick prototypes. But should
not be used as the default rendering approach. Use ~Hash~-based or ~Class~-based primitives.

While not recommended for long term maintainability, you can also set the following properties.

Example Creates a green solid rectangle with an opacity of 50% (the value for the color and alpha is a number between ~0~ and ~255~, the alpha property is optional and will be set to ~255~ if not specified):

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    #                         X    Y  WIDTH  HEIGHT  RED  GREEN  BLUE  ALPHA
    args.outputs.solids << [100, 100,   160,     90,   0,   255,    0,   128]
  end
#+end_src

*** Hash Render Primitive

If you want a more readable invocation. You can use the following hash to create a solid.
Any parameters that are not specified will be given a default value. The keys of the hash can
be provided in any order.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.solids << {
      x:    0,
      y:    0,
      w:  100,
      h:  100,
      r:    0,
      g:  255,
      b:    0,
      a:  255,
      anchor_x: 0,
      anchor_y: 0,
      blendmode_enum: 1
    }
  end
#+end_src

*** Class Render Primitive

You can also create a class with solid properties and render it as a primitive.
ALL properties must be on the class. --Additionally--, a method called ~primitive_marker~
must be defined on the class.

Here is an example:

#+begin_src ruby
  # Create type with ALL solid properties AND primitive_marker
  class Solid
    attr_accessor :x, :y, :w, :h, :r, :g, :b, :a, :anchor_x, :anchor_y, :blendmode_enum
  
    def primitive_marker
      :solid # or :border
    end
  end
  
  # Inherit from type
  class Square < Solid
    # constructor
    def initialize x, y, size
      self.x = x
      self.y = y
      self.w = size
      self.h = size
    end
  end
  
  def tick args
    # render solid/border
    args.outputs.solids  << Square.new(10, 10, 32)
  end
#+end_src

** ~borders~

Add primitives to this collection to render an unfilled solid to the screen. Take a look at the
documentation for Outputs#solids.

The only difference between the two primitives is where they are added.

Instead of using ~args.outputs.solids~:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    #                         X    Y  WIDTH  HEIGHT
    args.outputs.solids << [100, 100,   160,     90]
  end
#+end_src

You have to use ~args.outputs.borders~:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    #                           X    Y  WIDTH  HEIGHT
    args.outputs.borders << [100, 100,   160,     90]
  end
#+end_src

** ~sprites~

Add primitives to this collection to render a sprite to the screen.

*** Properties

Here are all the properties that you can set on a sprite. The only required ones are ~x~, ~y~, ~w~, ~h~, and ~path~.

**** Required

- ~x~: X position of the sprite. Note: the bottom left corner of the sprite is used for positioning (this can be changed using ~anchor_x~, and ~anchor_y~).
- ~y~: Y position of the sprite. Note: The origin 0,0 is at the bottom left corner. Setting ~y~ to a higher value will move the sprite upwards.
- ~w~: The render width.
- ~h~: The render height.
- ~path~: The path of the sprite relative to the game folder.

**** Anchors and Rotations

- ~flip_horizontally~: This value can be either ~true~ or ~false~ and controls if the sprite will be flipped horizontally (default value is false).
- ~flip_vertically~: This value can be either ~true~ or ~false~ and controls if the sprite will be flipped vertically (default value is false).
- ~anchor_x~: Used to determine anchor point of the sprite's X position (relative to the render width).
- ~anchor_y~: Used to determine anchor point of the sprite's Y position (relative to the render height).
- ~angle~: Rotation of the sprite in degrees (default value is 0). Rotation occurs around the center of the sprite. The point of rotation can be changed using ~angle_anchor_x~ and ~angle_anchor_y~.
- ~angle_anchor_x~: Controls the point of rotation for the sprite (relative to the render width).
- ~angle_anchor_y~: Controls the point of rotation for the sprite (relative to the render height).

Here's an example of rendering a 80x80 pixel sprite in the center of the screen:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 640 - 40, # the logical center of the screen horizontally is 640, minus half the width of the sprite
      y: 360 - 40, # the logical center of the screen vertically is 360, minus half the height of the sprite
      w: 80,
      h: 80,
      path: "sprites/square/blue.png"
   }
  end
#+end_src

Instead of computing the offset, you can use ~anchor_x~, and ~anchor_y~ to center the sprite. The following is equivalent to the code above:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 640,
      y: 360,
      w: 80,
      h: 80,
      path: "sprites/square/blue.png",
      anchor_x: 0.5, # position horizontally at 0.5 of the sprite's width
      anchor_y: 0.5  # position vertically at 0.5 of the sprite's height
   }
  end
#+end_src

**** Cropping

- ~tile_(x|y|w|h)~: Defines the crop area to use for a sprite. The origin for ~tile_~ properties uses the TOP LEFT as its origin (useful for cropping tiles from a sprite sheet).
- ~source_(x|y|w|h)~: Defines the crop area to use for a sprite. The origin for ~source_~ properties uses the BOTTOM LEFT as its origin.

See the sample apps under ~./samples/03_rendering_sprites~ for examples of how to use this properties non-trivially.

**** Blending

- ~a~: Alpha/transparency of the sprite from 0 to 255 (default value is 255).
- ~r~: Level of red saturation for the sprite (default value is 255). Example: Setting the value to zero will remove all red coloration from the sprite.
- ~g~: Level of green saturation for the sprite (default value is 255).
- ~b~: Level of blue saturation for the sprite (default value is 255).
- ~blendmode_enum~: Valid options are ~0~: no blending, ~1~: default/alpha blending, ~2~: additive blending, ~3~: modulo blending, ~4~: multiply blending.
- ~scale_quality_enum~: Valid options are ~0~: nearest neighbor, ~1~: linear scaling, ~2~: anti-aliasing. If the value is ~nil~ then the ~scale_quality~ value that was set in ~mygame/game_metadata.txt~ will be used.

The following sample apps show how ~blendmode_enum~ can be leveraged to create coloring and lighting effects:

- ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/11_blend_modes~
- ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/13_lighting~

**** Triangles

To rendering using triangles, instead of providing a ~w~, ~h~ property, provide ~x2~, ~y2~, ~x3~, ~y3~. This applies for positioning and cropping.

Here is an example:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      x2: 80,
      y2: 0,
      x3: 0,
      y3: 80,
      source_x: 0,
      source_y: 0,
      source_x2: 80,
      source_y2: 0,
      source_x3: 0,
      source_y3: 80,
      path: "sprites/square/blue.png"
    }
  end
#+end_src

For more example of rendering using triangles see:

- ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/14_triangles~
- ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/15_triangles_trapezoid~
- ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/16_matrix_and_triangles_2d~
- ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/16_matrix_and_triangles_3d~
- ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/16_matrix_cubeworld~

*** Array Render Primitive

Creates a sprite of a white circle located at 100, 100. 160 pixels
wide and 90 pixels tall.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    #                         X    Y   WIDTH   HEIGHT                      PATH
    args.outputs.sprites << [100, 100,   160,     90, "sprites/circle/white.png"]
  end
#+end_src

NOTE:

 Array-based sprites have limited access to sprite properties, but
nice for quick prototyping. Use a ~Hash~ or ~Class~ to
gain access to all properties, gain long term maintainability of code,
and a boost in rendering performance.

*** Hash Render Primitive

If you want a more readable (and faster) invocation, you can use the following hash to create a sprite.
Any parameters that are not specified will be given a default value. The keys of the hash can
be provided in any order.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      w: 100,
      h: 100,
      path: "sprites/circle/white.png",
      angle: 0,
      a: 255
    }
  end
#+end_src

*** Class Render Primitive

You can also create a class with sprite properties and render it as a primitive.
ALL properties must be on the class. --Additionally--, a method called ~primitive_marker~
must be defined on the class.

Here is an example:

#+begin_src ruby
  # Create type with ALL sprite properties AND primitive_marker
  class Sprite
    attr_accessor :x, :y, :w, :h, :path, :angle, :a, :r, :g, :b, :tile_x,
                  :tile_y, :tile_w, :tile_h, :flip_horizontally,
                  :flip_vertically, :angle_anchor_x, :angle_anchor_y, :id,
                  :angle_x, :angle_y, :z,
                  :source_x, :source_y, :source_w, :source_h, :blendmode_enum,
                  :source_x2, :source_y2, :source_x3, :source_y3, :x2, :y2, :x3, :y3,
                  :anchor_x, :anchor_y, :scale_quality_enum
  
    def primitive_marker
      :sprite
    end
  end
  
  # Inherit from type
  class Circle < Sprite
    # constructor
    def initialize x, y, size, path
      self.x = x
      self.y = y
      self.w = size
      self.h = size
      self.path = path
    end
  
    def serialize
      {x:self.x, y:self.y, w:self.w, h:self.h, path:self.path}
    end
  
    def inspect
      serialize.to_s
    end
  
    def to_s
      serialize.to_s
    end
  end
  
  def tick args
    # render circle sprite
    args.outputs.sprites  << Circle.new(10, 10, 32,"sprites/circle/white.png")
  end
#+end_src

*** ~attr_sprite~

The ~attr_sprite~ class macro adds all properties needed to render a sprite to a class. This removes
the need to manually define all sprites properties that DragonRuby offers for rendering.

Instead of manually defining the properties, you can represent a sprite using the ~attr_sprite~ class macro:

#+begin_src ruby
  class BlueSquare
    # invoke the helper function at the class level for
    # anything you want to represent as a sprite
    attr_sprite
  
    def initialize(x: 0, y: 0, w: 0, h: 0)
      @x = x
      @y = y
      @w = w
      @h = h
      @path = 'sprites/square-blue.png'
    end
  end
  
  def tick args
    args.outputs.sprites << BlueSquare.new(x: 640 - 50,
                                           y: 360 - 50,
                                           w: 50,
                                           h: 50)
  end
#+end_src

** ~lines~

Add primitives to this collection to render a line.

*** Array Render Primitive

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
                           #  X    Y   X2   Y2
    args.outputs.lines << [100, 100, 150, 150]
  end
#+end_src

NOTE:

 ~Array~-based primitives are find for debugging purposes/quick prototypes. But should
not be used as the default rendering approach. Use ~Hash~-based or ~Class~-based primitives.

*** Hash Render Primitive

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.lines << {
      x:  100,
      y:  100,
      x2: 150,
      y2: 150,
      r:  0,
      g:  0,
      b:  0,
      a:  255,
      blendmode_enum: 1
    }
  end
#+end_src

*** Class Render Primitive

#+begin_src ruby
  # Create type with ALL line properties AND primitive_marker
  class Line
    attr_accessor :x, :y, :x2, :y2, :r, :g, :b, :a, :blendmode_enum
  
    def primitive_marker
      :line
    end
  end
  
  # Inherit from type
  class RedLine < Line
    # constructor
    def initialize x, y, x2, y2
      self.x = x
      self.y = y
      self.x2 = x2
      self.y2 = y2
      self.r  = 255
      self.g  = 0
      self.b  = 0
      self.a  = 255
    end
  end
  
  def tick args
    # render line
    args.outputs.lines << RedLine.new(100, 100, 150, 150)
  end
  
#+end_src

** ~labels~

Add primitives to this collection to render a label.

*** Array Render Primitive

Labels represented as Arrays/Tuples:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
                           #        X         Y              TEXT   SIZE_ENUM
    args.outputs.labels << [175 + 150, 610 - 50, "Smaller label.",         0]
  end
#+end_src

Here are all the properties that you can set with a
label represented as an Array. It's recommended to move over to
using Hashes once you've specified a lot of properties.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.labels << [
      640,                   # X
      360,                   # Y
      "Hello world",         # TEXT
      0,                     # SIZE_ENUM
      1,                     # ALIGNMENT_ENUM
      0,                     # RED
      0,                     # GREEN
      0,                     # BLUE
      255,                   # ALPHA
      "fonts/coolfont.ttf"   # FONT
    ]
  end
#+end_src

NOTE:

 ~Array~-based primitives are find for debugging purposes/quick prototypes. But should
not be used as the default rendering approach. Use ~Hash~-based or ~Class~-based primitives.

*** Hash Render Primitive

?> ~size_enum~ is an opaque unit and signifies the recommended size for labels. The default ~size_enum~ of ~0~
means "this size is the smallest font size that is comfortable to read on a hand-held device". ~size_enum~ of ~0~
corresponds to ~22px~ at ~720p~. Each increment of ~size_enum~ increases/decreases the pixels by ~2~ (~size_enum~ of ~1~ means ~24px~,
~size_enum~ of ~-1~ means ~20px~, etc). If you want to control the size of a label explicitly, use ~size_px~ instead.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args

** Render Targets (~[]~ operator)

The ~args.outputs~ structure renders to the screen. You can render to
a texture/virtual canvas using ~args.outputs[SYMBOL]~. What ever
primitives are sent to the virtual canvas are cached and reused (the
cache is invalidated whenever you render to virtual canvas).

?> You can also use render targets to accomplish many complex layouts
such as a game camera, perform scene management, or add lighting.




Take a look at the following sample apps:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sample apps under ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering~.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Map Editor reference implementation (~samples/99_genre_platformer/map_editor~).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcade game Square Fall (~samples/99_genre_arcade/squares~).




Many of the sample apps use render targets, so be sure to explore as
many as you can!

Here's an example that programmatically creates a ~:combined~ sprite composed of
two pngs and a label:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # on tick 0, create a render target composed of two sprites and a label
    if Kernel.tick_count == 0
      # to reiterate, this sprite will be cached until it's written to again
      # the :combined sprite has a w/h of 200
      args.outputs[:combined].w = 200
      args.outputs[:combined].h = 200
  
      # and a black transparent background
      args.outputs[:combined].background_color = [0, 0, 0, 0]
  
      # add two sprites to the render target
      args.outputs[:combined].primitives << {
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        w: 100,
        h: 200,
        path: "sprites/square/blue.png"
      }
  
      args.outputs[:combined].primitives << {
        x: 100,
        y: 0,
        w: 100,
        h: 200,
        path: "sprites/square/red.png"
      }
  
      # add a label in the center of the render target
      args.outputs[:combined].primitives << {
        x: 100,
        y: 100,
        text: "COMBINED!",
        anchor_x: 0.5,
        anchor_y: 0.5,
      }
    end
  
    # rendered the :combined sprite in multiple
    # places on the screen
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      w: 400,
      h: 400,
      path: :combined,
      angle: 33
    }
  
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 640,
      y: 360,
      w: 100,
      h: 100,
      path: :combined,
      angle: 180,
      a: 128
    }
  end
#+end_src

Render targets are extremely powerful and you'll end up using them a
lot (so be sure to get familiar with them by studying the sample apps).

NOTE:

 Take note that simply accessing a render target via ~args.outputs[]~ will invalidate the cached texture. Proceed with caution!

Here's an example of this side-effect:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # Create the render target only on the first tick.
    # It's then cached and used indefinitely until it's
    # accessed again.
    if Kernel.tick_count <= 0
      args.outputs[:render_target].w = 100
      args.outputs[:render_target].h = 100
      args.outputs[:render_target].sprites << {
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        w: 100,
        h: 100,
        r: 0,
        b: 0,
        g: 0,
        a: 64,
        path: :solid
      }
    end
  
    # CAUTION: accessing the render target will invalidate it!
    #          don't do this unless you're wanting to update the
    #          texture
    render_target = args.outputs[:render_target]
  
    # store information you need about a render target in state
    # or an iVar/member variable instead of accessing the render target
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 100,
      y: 100,
      w: render_target.w,
      h: render_target.h,
      path: :render_target,
    }
  end
#+end_src

** ~screenshots~

Add a hash to this collection to take a screenshot and save as png file.
The keys of the hash can be provided in any order.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.screenshots << {
      x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100,    # Which portion of the screen should be captured
      path: 'screenshot.png',        # Output path of PNG file (inside game directory)
      r: 255, g: 255, b: 255, a: 0   # Optional chroma key
    }
  end
#+end_src

*** Chroma key (Making a color transparent)

By specifying the r, g, b and a keys of the hash you change the transparency of a color in the resulting PNG file.
This can be useful if you want to create files with transparent background like spritesheets.
The transparency of the color specified by ~r~, ~g~, ~b~ will be set to the transparency specified by ~a~.

The example above sets the color white (255, 255, 255) as transparent.

** Shaders

Shaders are available to Indie and Pro license holders via
~dragonruby-shadersim~. Download DragonRuby ShaderSim at [dragonruby.org](https://dragonruby.org).

NOTE:

 Shaders are currently in Beta.




Shaders must be GLSL ES2 compatible.




The long term goal is for DR Shaders to baseline to GLSL
version 300 and cross-compile to Vulkan, WebGL 2, Metal, and HLSL.

Here is a minimal example of using shaders:

#+begin_src ruby
  # mygame/app/main.rb
  def tick args
    args.outputs.shader_path ||= "shaders/example.glsl"
  end
#+end_src

#+begin_src glsl
  // mygame/shaders/example.glsl
  uniform sampler2D tex0;
  
  varying vec2 v_texCoord;
  
  void main() {
    gl_FragColor = texture2D(tex0, v_texCoord);
  }
#+end_src

*** ~shader_path~

Setting ~shader_path~ on ~outputs~ signifies to DragonRuby that a
shader should be compiled and loaded.

*** ~shader_uniforms~

You can bind uniforms to a shader by providing an ~Array~ of ~Hashes~
to ~shader_uniforms~ with keys ~name:~, ~value:~, and ~type:~ which
currently supports ~:int~ and ~:float~.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.shader_path ||= "shaders/example.glsl"
  
    args.outputs.shader_uniforms = [
      {
        name: :mouse_coord_x,
        value: args.inputs.mouse.x.fdiv(1280),
        type: :float
      },
      {
        name: :mouse_coord_y,
        value: 1.0 - args.inputs.mouse.y.fdiv(720),
        type: :float
      },
      {
        name: :tick_count,
        value: Kernel.tick_count,
        type: :int
      }
    ]
  end
#+end_src

#+begin_src glsl
  // mygame/shaders/example.glsl
  uniform sampler2D tex0;
  
  uniform float mouse_coord_x;
  uniform float mouse_coord_y;
  uniform int tick_count;
  
  varying vec2 v_texCoord;
  
  void main() {
    gl_FragColor = texture2D(tex0, v_texCoord);
  }
#+end_src

*** ~shader_tex(1-15)~

You can bind up to 15 additional render targets via ~shaders_tex1~,
~shaders_tex2~, ~shaders_tex3~, etc. ~tex0~ is reserved for what has
been rendered to the screen and cannot be set.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.shader_path = "shaders/example.glsl"
    args.outputs.shader_tex1 = :single_blue_square
  
    args.outputs[:single_blue_square].background_color = { r: 255, g: 255, b: 255, a: 255 }
    args.outputs[:single_blue_square].w = 1280;
    args.outputs[:single_blue_square].h = 720;
    args.outputs[:single_blue_square].sprites << {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      w: 100,
      h: 100,
      path:
      "sprites/square/blue.png"
    }
  
    args.outputs.background_color = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0 }
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      w: 200,
      h: 200,
      path:
      "sprites/square/red.png"
    }
  end
#+end_src

#+begin_src glsl
  uniform sampler2D tex0;
  uniform sampler2D tex1; // :single_blue_square render target
  
  varying vec2 v_texCoord;
  
  void noop() {
    vec4 pixel_from_rt = texture2D(tex1, v_texCoord);
  
    // if the pixel from the render target isn't white
    // then render the pixel from the RT
    // otherwise render the pixel from the screen
    if (pixel_from_rt.r < 1.0 ||
        pixel_from_rt.g < 1.0 ||
        pixel_from_rt.b < 1.0) {
      gl_FragColor.r = pixel_from_rt.r;
      gl_FragColor.g = pixel_from_rt.g;
      gl_FragColor.b = pixel_from_rt.b;
    } else {
      gl_FragColor = texture2D(tex0, v_texCoord);
    }
  }
#+end_src

  end
#+end_src

*** ~wheel~

Represents the mouse wheel. Returns ~nil~ if no mouse wheel actions occurred. Otherwise ~args.inputs.mouse.wheel~ will return a ~Hash~ with ~x~, and ~y~ (representing movement on each axis).

*** ~click~ OR ~down~, ~previous_click~, ~up~

The properties ~args.inputs.mouse.(click|down|previous_click|up)~ each return ~nil~ if the mouse button event didn't occur. And return an Entity that has an ~x~, ~y~ properties along with helper functions to determine collision: ~inside_rect?~, ~inside_circle~. This value will be true if any of the mouse's buttons caused these events. To scope to a specific button use ~.button_left~, ~.button_middle~, ~.button_right~, or ~.button_bits~.

*** ~key_down~

Returns ~true~ if the specific button was pressed on this frame. ~args.inputs.mouse.key_down.BUTTON~ will only be true on the frame it was pressed.

- ~left~ (eg ~args.inputs.mouse.key_down.left~)
- ~middle~
- ~right~

*** ~key_held~

Returns ~true~ if the specific button is being held. ~args.inputs.mouse.key_held.BUTTON~ will be true for all frames after ~key_down~ (until released).

*** ~key_up~

Returns ~true~ if the specific button was released. ~args.inputs.mouse.key_up.BUTTON~ will be true only on the frame the button was released.

?> For a full demonstration of all mouse button states, refer to the
sample app located at ~./samples/02_input_basics/02_mouse_properties~

** Touch

The following touch apis are available on touch devices (iOS, Android, Mobile Web, Surface).

*** ~args.inputs.touch~

Returns a ~Hash~ representing all touch points on a touch device.

*** ~args.inputs.finger_left~

Returns a ~Hash~ with ~x~ and ~y~ denoting a touch point that is on the left side of the screen.

*** ~args.inputs.finger_right~

Returns a ~Hash~ with ~x~ and ~y~ denoting a touch point that is on the right side of the screen.

** Controller (~args.inputs.controller_(one-four)~)

Represents controllers connected to the usb ports. There is also ~args.inputs.controllers~ which returns controllers one through four as an array (~args.inputs.controllers[0]~ points to ~args.inputs.controller_one~).

*** ~connected~

Returns ~true~ if a controller is connected. If this value is ~false~, controller properties
will not be ~nil~, but return ~0~ for directional based properties and ~false~ button state properties.

*** ~name~

String value representing the controller's name.

*** ~active~

Returns true if any of the controller's buttons were used.

*** ~up~

Returns ~true~ if ~up~ is pressed or held on the directional or left analog.

*** ~down~

Returns ~true~ if ~down~ is pressed or held on the directional or left analog.

*** ~left~

Returns ~true~ if ~left~ is pressed or held on the directional or left analog.

*** ~right~

Returns ~true~ if ~right~ is pressed or held on the directional or left analog.

*** ~left_right~

Returns ~-1~ (left), ~0~ (neutral), or ~+1~ (right) depending on results of ~args.inputs.controller_(one-four).left~ and ~args.inputs.controller_(one-four).right~.

*** ~up_down~

Returns ~-1~ (down), ~0~ (neutral), or ~+1~ (up) depending on results of ~args.inputs.controller_(one-four).up~ and ~args.inputs.controller_(one-four).down~.

*** ~(left|right)_analog_x_raw~

Returns the raw integer value for the analog's horizontal movement (~-32,767 to +32,767~).

*** ~(left|right)_analog_y_raw~

Returns the raw integer value for the analog's vertical movement (~-32,767 to +32,767~).

*** ~(left|right)_analog_x_perc~

Returns a number between ~-1~ and ~1~ which represents the percentage the analog is moved horizontally as a ratio of the maximum horizontal movement.

*** ~(left|right)_analog_y_perc~

Returns a number between ~-1~ and ~1~ which represents the percentage the analog is moved vertically as a ratio of the maximum vertical movement.

*** ~dpad_up~, ~directional_up~

Returns ~true~ if ~up~ is pressed or held on the dpad.

*** ~dpad_down~, ~directional_down~

Returns ~true~ if ~down~ is pressed or held on the dpad.

*** ~dpad_left~, ~directional_left~

Returns ~true~ if ~left~ is pressed or held on the dpad.

*** ~dpad_right~, ~directional_right~

Returns ~true~ if ~right~ is pressed or held on the dpad.

*** ~(a|b|x|y|l1|r1|l2|r2|l3|r3|start|select)~

Returns ~true~ if the specific button is pressed or held. Note: For PS4 and PS5 controllers ~a~ maps to Cross, ~b~ maps to Circle, ~x~ maps to Square, and ~y~ maps to Triangle.

*** ~truthy_keys~

Returns a collection of ~Symbol~s that represent all keys that are in the pressed or held state.

*** ~key_down~

Returns ~true~ if the specific button was pressed on this frame. ~args.inputs.controller_(one-four).key_down.BUTTON~ will only be true on the frame it was pressed.

*** ~key_held~

Returns ~true~ if the specific button is being held. ~args.inputs.controller_(one-four).key_held.BUTTON~ will be true for all frames after ~key_down~ (until released).

*** ~key_up~

Returns ~true~ if the specific button was released. ~args.inputs.controller_(one-four).key_up.BUTTON~ will be true only on the frame the button was released.

*** ~left_analog_active?(threshold_raw:, threshold_perc:)~

Returns true if the Left Analog Stick is tilted. The ~threshold_raw~
and ~threshold_perc~ are optional parameters that can be used to set
the minimum threshold for the analog stick to be considered
active. The ~threshold_raw~ is a number between 0 and 32,767, and the
~threshold_perc~ is a number between 0 and 1.

*** ~right_analog_active?(threshold_raw:, threshold_perc:)~

Returns true if the Right Analog Stick is tilted. The ~threshold_raw~
and ~threshold_perc~ are optional parameters that can be used to set
the minimum threshold for the analog stick to be considered
active. The ~threshold_raw~ is a number between 0 and 32,767, and the
~threshold_perc~ is a number between 0 and 1.

*** ~analog_dead_zone~

The default value for this property is ~3600~. You can set this to a
lower value for a more responsive analog stick, though it's not
recommended (the Steam Deck analog sticks don't always settle back to
a value lower than ~3600~).

*** ~key_STATE?(key)~

There are situations where you may want to get the status of a key
dynamically as opposed to accessing a property. The following methods
are provided to assist in this:

- ~key_down?(key)~
- ~key_up?(key)~
- ~key_held?(key)~
- ~key_down_or_held?(key)~

Given a symbol, these functions return ~true~ or ~false~ if the key is in the
current state.

Here's how each of these methods are equivalent to key-based methods:

#+begin_src ruby
  # key_down equivalent
  args.inputs.controller_one.key_down.enter
  args.inputs.controller_one.key_down?(:enter)
  
  # key_up
  args.inputs.controller_one.key_up.enter
  args.inputs.controller_one.key_up?(:enter)
  
  # key held
  args.inputs.controller_one.key_held.enter
  args.inputs.controller_one.key_held?(:enter)
  
  # key down or held
  args.inputs.controller_one.enter
  args.inputs.controller_one.key_down_or_held?(:enter)
#+end_src

Represents the user's keyboard.

*** ~active~

Returns ~Kernel.tick_count~ if any keys on the keyboard were pressed.

*** ~has_focus~

Returns ~true~ if the game has keyboard focus.

*** ~up~

Returns ~true~ if ~up~ or ~w~ is pressed or held on the keyboard.

*** ~down~

Returns ~true~ if ~down~ or ~s~ is pressed or held on the keyboard.

*** ~left~

Returns ~true~ if ~left~ or ~a~ is pressed or held on the keyboard.

*** ~right~

Returns ~true~ if ~right~ or ~d~ is pressed or held on the keyboard.

*** ~left_right~

Returns ~-1~ (left), ~0~ (neutral), or ~+1~ (right) depending on results of ~args.inputs.keyboard.left~ and ~args.inputs.keyboard.right~.

*** ~up_down~

Returns ~-1~ (left), ~0~ (neutral), or ~+1~ (right) depending on results of ~args.inputs.keyboard.up~ and ~args.inputs.keyboard.up~.

*** Keyboard properties

The following properties represent keys on the keyboard and are available on ~args.inputs.keyboard.KEY~, ~args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.KEY~, ~args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.KEY~, ~args.inputs.keyboard.key_up.KEY~, ~args.inputs.keyboard.key_repeat.KEY~:

Here is an example showing all the ways to access a key's state:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # create a value in state to
    # track tick_count of the G key
    args.state.g_key ||= {
      ctrl_at: nil,
      key_down_at: nil,
      key_repeat_at: nil,
      key_last_repeat_at: nil,
      key_held_at: nil,
      key_down_or_held_at: nil,
      key_up_at: nil,
    }
  
    # for each keyboard event, capture the tick_count
    # that the event occurred
    # Ctrl + G
    if args.inputs.keyboard.ctrl_g
      args.state.g_key.ctrl_at = args.inputs.keyboard.ctrl_g
    end
  
    # G pressed/down
    if args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.g
      args.state.g_key.key_down_at = args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.g
    end
  
    # G pressed or repeated (based on OS key repeat speed)
    if args.inputs.keyboard.key_repeat.g
      args.state.g_key.key_last_repeat_at = args.state.g_key.key_repeat_at
      args.state.g_key.key_repeat_at = args.inputs.keyboard.key_repeat.g
    end
  
    # G held
    if args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.g
      args.state.g_key.key_held_at = args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.g
    end
  
    # G down or held
    if args.inputs.keyboard.g
      args.state.g_key.key_down_or_held_at = args.inputs.keyboard.g
    end
  
    # G up
    if args.inputs.keyboard.key_up.g
      args.state.g_key.key_up_at = args.inputs.keyboard.key_up.g
    end
  
    # display the tick_count of each event
    args.outputs.debug.watch "ctrl+g?         #{args.state.g_key.ctrl_at}"
    args.outputs.debug.watch "g down?         #{args.state.g_key.key_down_at}"
    args.outputs.debug.watch "g repeat?       #{args.state.g_key.key_repeat_at}"
    args.outputs.debug.watch "g last_repeat?  #{args.state.g_key.key_last_repeat_at}"
    args.outputs.debug.watch "g held?         #{args.state.g_key.key_held_at}"
    args.outputs.debug.watch "g down or held? #{args.state.g_key.key_down_or_held_at}"
    args.outputs.debug.watch "g up?           #{args.state.g_key.key_up_at}"
  end

*** ~keycodes~

If the explicit named key isn't in the list above, you can still get the raw keycode via ~args.inputs.keyboard.key_(down|held|up).keycodes[KEYCODE_NUMBER]~. The ~KEYCODE_NUMBER~ represents the keycode provided by SDL.

Here is a list SDL Keycodes: <https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDLKeycodeLookup>

*** ~char~

Method is available under ~inputs.key_down~, ~inputs.key_held~, and ~inputs.key_up~. Take note that
~args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.char~ will only return the ascii value of the last key that was held. Use
~args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.truthy_keys~ to get an ~Array~ of ~Symbols~ representing all keys being held.

To get a picture of all key states ~args.inputs.keyboard.keys~ returns a ~Hash~ with the following keys: ~:down~, ~:held~, ~:down_or_held~, ~:up~.

NOTE: ~args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.char~ will be set in line with key repeat behavior of your OS.

This is a demonstration of the behavior (see ~./samples/02_input_basics/01_keyboard~ for a more detailed example):

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # uncomment the line below to see the value changes at a slower rate
    # $gtk.slowmo! 30
  
    keyboard = args.inputs.keyboard
  
    args.outputs.labels << { x: 30,
                             y: 720,
                             text: "use the J key to test" }
  
    args.outputs.labels << { x: 30,
                             y: 720 - 30,
                             text: "key_down.char: #{keyboard.key_down.char.inspect}" }
  
    args.outputs.labels << { x: 30,
                             y: 720 - 60,
                             text: "key_down.j:    #{keyboard.key_down.j}" }
  
    args.outputs.labels << { x: 30,
                             y: 720 - 30,
                             text: "key_held.char: #{keyboard.key_held.char.inspect}" }
  
    args.outputs.labels << { x: 30,
                             y: 720 - 60,
                             text: "key_held.j:    #{keyboard.key_held.j}" }
  
    args.outputs.labels << { x: 30,
                             y: 720 - 30,
                             text: "key_up.char:   #{keyboard.key_up.char.inspect}" }
  
    args.outputs.labels << { x: 30,
                             y: 720 - 60,
                             text: "key_up.j:      #{keyboard.key_up.j}" }
  end
#+end_src

*** ~key_STATE?(key)~

There are situations where you may want to get the status of a key
dynamically as opposed to accessing a property. The following methods
are provided to assist in this:

- ~key_down?(key)~
- ~key_up?(key)~
- ~key_held?(key)~
- ~key_down_or_held?(key)~
- ~key_repeat?(key)~

Given a symbol, these methods return ~true~ or ~false~ if the key is in the
current state.

Here's how each of these methods are equivalent to key-based methods:

#+begin_src ruby
  # key_down equivalent
  args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.enter
  args.inputs.keyboard.key_down?(:enter)
  
  # key_up
  args.inputs.keyboard.key_up.enter
  args.inputs.keyboard.key_up?(:enter)
  
  # key held
  args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.enter
  args.inputs.keyboard.key_held?(:enter)
  
  # key down or held
  args.inputs.keyboard.enter
  args.inputs.keyboard.key_down_or_held?(:enter)
#+end_src

*** ~keys~

Returns a ~Hash~ with all keys on the keyboard in their respective state. The ~Hash~ contains the following ~keys~

-   ~:down~
-   ~:held~
-   ~:down_or_held~
-   ~:up~
-   ~:repeat~
* Runtime (~args.gtk~)

The ~GTK::Runtime~ class is the core of DragonRuby.

?> All functions ~$gtk~, ~GTK~, or inside of the ~tick~ method through ~args~.
#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.gtk.function(...)
  
    # OR available globally
    $gtk.function(...)
    # OR
    GTK.function(...)
  end
#+end_src

** Class Macros

The following class macros are available within DragonRuby.

*** ~attr~

The ~attr~ class macro is an alias to ~attr_accessor~.

Instead of:

#+begin_src ruby
  class Player
    attr_accessor :hp, :armor
  end
#+end_src

You can do:

#+begin_src ruby
  class Player
    attr :hp, :armor
  end
#+end_src

*** ~attr_gtk~

As the size/complexity of your game increases. You may want to create classes to organize everything. The ~attr_gtk~ class macro adds DragonRuby's environment methods (such as ~args.state~, ~args.inputs~, ~args.outputs~, ~args.audio~, etc) to your class so you don't have to pass ~args~ around everywhere.

Instead of:

#+begin_src ruby
  class Game
    def tick args
      defaults args
      calc args
      render args
    end
  
    def defaults args
      args.state.space_pressed_at ||= 0
    end
  
    def calc args
      if args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.space
        args.state.space_pressed_at = Kernel.tick_count
      end
    end
  
    def render args
      if args.state.space_pressed_at == 0
        args.outputs.labels << { x: 100, y: 100,
                                 text: "press space" }
      else
        args.outputs.labels << { x: 100, y: 100,
                                 text: "space was pressed at: #{args.state.space_pressed_at}" }
      end
    end
  end
  
  def tick args
    $game ||= Game.new
    $game.tick args
  end
#+end_src

You can do:

#+begin_src ruby
  class Game
    attr_gtk # attr_gtk class macro
  
    def tick
      defaults
      calc
      render
    end
  
    def defaults
      state.space_pressed_at ||= 0
    end
  
    def calc
      if inputs.keyboard.key_down.space
        state.space_pressed_at = Kernel.tick_count
      end
    end
  
    def render
      if state.space_pressed_at == 0
        outputs.labels << { x: 100, y: 100,
                            text: "press space" }
      else
        outputs.labels << { x: 100, y: 100,
                            text: "space was pressed at: #{state.space_pressed_at}" }
      end
    end
  end
  
  def tick args
    $game ||= Game.new
    $game.args = args # set args property on game
    $game.tick        # call tick without passing in args
  end
  
  $game = nil
#+end_src

** Indie and Pro Functions

The following functions are only available at the Indie and Pro License tiers.

*** ~get_pixels~

Given a ~file_path~ to a sprite, this function returns a ~Hash~ with ~w~, ~h~, and ~pixels~. The ~pixels~ key contains an array of hexadecimal values representing the ABGR of each pixel in a sprite with item ~0~ representing the top left corner of the ~png~.

Here's an example of how to get the color data for a pixel:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # load the pixels from the image
    args.state.image ||= args.gtk.get_pixels "sprites/square/blue.png"
  
    # initialize state variables for the pixel coordinates
    args.state.x_px ||= 0
    args.state.y_px ||= 0
  
    sprite_pixels = args.state.image.pixels
    sprite_h = args.state.image.h
    sprite_w = args.state.image.w
  
    # move the pixel coordinates using keyboard
    args.state.x_px += args.inputs.left_right
    args.state.y_px += args.inputs.up_down
  
    # get pixel at the current coordinates
    args.state.x_px = args.state.x_px.clamp(0, sprite_w - 1)
    args.state.y_px = args.state.y_px.clamp(0, sprite_h - 1)
    row = sprite_h - args.state.y_px - 1
    col = args.state.x_px
    abgr = sprite_pixels[sprite_h * row + col]
    a = (abgr >> 24) & 0xff
    b = (abgr >> 16) & 0xff
    g = (abgr >> 8) & 0xff
    r = (abgr >> 0) & 0xff
  
    # render debug information
    args.outputs.debug << "row: #{row} col: #{col}"
    args.outputs.debug << "pixel entry 0: rgba #{r} #{g} #{b} #{a}"
  
    # render the sprite plus crosshairs
    args.outputs.sprites << { x: 0, y: 0, w: 80, h: 80, path: "sprites/square/blue.png" }
    args.outputs.lines << { x: args.state.x_px, y: 0, h: 720 }
    args.outputs.lines << { x: 0, y: args.state.y_px, w: 1280 }
  end
#+end_src

See the following sample apps for how to use pixel arrays:

-   ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/06_pixel_arrays~
-   ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/06_pixel_arrays_from_file~

*** ~dlopen~

Loads a precompiled C Extension into your game given the ~name~ of the library (without the ~lib~ prefix or platform sepcific file extension).

See the sample apps at ~./samples/12_c_extensions~ for detailed walkthroughs of creating C extensions.

?> All license tiers can load C Extensions in dev mode. The Standard
license --does not include the dependencies required to create C
Extensions however--.

 During the publishing process, any C Extension
directories will be ignored during packaging and an exception will be
thrown if ~dlopen~ is called in Production (for Standard license
only).

 This gives Standard license users the ability to load/try out C
Extensions in development mode. An [Indie or Pro license](https://dragonruby.org#purchase) is required to
compile C Extensions/publish games that have C Extensions.

** Environment and Utility Functions

The following functions will help in interacting with the OS and rendering pipeline.

*** ~calcstringbox~

Returns the render width and render height as a tuple for a piece of text. The parameters this method takes are:

-   ~text~: the text you want to get the width and height of.
-   ~size_enum~: number representing the render size for the text. This parameter is optional and defaults to ~0~ which represents a baseline font size in units specific to DragonRuby (a negative value denotes a size smaller than what would be comfortable to read on a handheld device positive values above ~0~ represent larger font sizes).
-   ~font~: path to a font file that the width and height will be based off of. This field is optional and defaults to the DragonRuby's default font.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    text = "a piece of text"
    size_enum = 5 # "large font size"
  
    # path is relative to your game directory (eg mygame/fonts/courier-new.ttf)
    font = "fonts/courier-new.ttf"
  
    # get the render width and height
    string_w, string_h = args.gtk.calcstringbox text, size_enum, font
  
    # render the label
    args.outputs.labels << {
      x: 100,
      y: 100,
      text: text,
      size_enum: size_enum,
      font: font
    }
  
    # render a border around the label based on the results from calcstringbox
    args.outputs.borders << {
      x: 100,
      y: 100,
      w: string_w,
      h: string_h,
      r: 0,
      g: 0,
      b: 0
    }
  end
#+end_src

~calcstringbox~ also supports named parameters for ~size_enum~ and ~size_px~.

#+begin_src ruby
    # size_enum, and font named parameters
    string_w, string_h = args.gtk.calcstringbox text, size_enum: 0, font: "fonts/example.ttf"
  
    # size_px, and font named parameters
    string_w, string_h = args.gtk.calcstringbox text, size_px: 20, font: "fonts/example.ttf"
#+end_src

*** ~request_quit~

Call this function to exit your game. You will be given one additional tick if you need to perform any housekeeping before that game closes.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # exit the game after 600 frames (10 seconds)
    if Kernel.tick_count == 600
      args.gtk.request_quit
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~quit_requested?~

This function will return ~true~ if the game is about to exit (either from the user closing the game or if ~request_quit~ was invoked).

*** ~set_window_fullscreen~

This function takes in a single ~boolean~ parameter. ~true~ to make the game fullscreen, ~false~ to return the game back to windowed mode.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # make the game full screen after 600 frames (10 seconds)
    if Kernel.tick_count == 600
      args.gtk.set_window_fullscreen true
    end
  
    # return the game to windowed mode after 20 seconds
    if Kernel.tick_count == 1200
      args.gtk.set_window_fullscreen false
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~window_fullscreen?~

Returns ~true~ if the window is currently in fullscreen mode.

*** ~set_window_scale~

NOTE:

 This function should only be used for debugging/development purposes and is not guaranteed to work cross platform. Do not use as a in-game feature in production.

The first parameter is a float value used to resize the game
window to a percentage of 1280x720 (or 720x1280 in portrait mode). The
valid scale options are 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5,
3.0, and 4.0. The float value you pass in will be floored to the
nearest valid scale option.

The second and third parameters are optional and default to ~16~ and
~9~ (representing with width and height aspect ratios for the
window). Providing these parameters will resize the window with the
non-standard aspect ratio. This is useful for testing letter-boxing
and All Screen modes (Pro feature).

Setting the window scale to the following will give a good
representation of your game on various form factors.

#+begin_src ruby
  # how your game will look on an iPad
  GTK.set_window_scale 1.0, 4, 3
  
  # how your game will look on a wide aspect ratio
  GTK.set_window_scale 1.0, 21, 9
#+end_src

*** ~set_window_title~

NOTE:

 This function should only be used for debugging/development purposes and is not guaranteed to work cross platform. Do not use as a in-game feature in production.

This function takes in a string updates the title of the game in the Menu Bar.

Note: The default title for your game is specified in via the ~gametitle~ property in ~mygame/metadata/game_metadata.txt~.

*** ~platform?~

You can ask DragonRuby which platform your game is currently being run on. This can be useful if you want to perform different pieces of logic based on where the game is running.

The raw platform string value is available via ~args.gtk.platform~ which takes in a ~symbol~ representing the platform's categorization/mapping.

You can see all available platform categorizations via the ~args.gtk.platform_mappings~ function.

Here's an example of how to use ~args.gtk.platform? category_symbol~:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    label_style = { x: 640, y: 360, anchor_x: 0.5, anchor_y: 0.5 }
    if    args.gtk.platform? :macos
      args.outputs.labels << { text: "I am running on MacOS.", **label_style }
    elsif args.gtk.platform? :win
      args.outputs.labels << { text: "I am running on Windows.", **label_style }
    elsif args.gtk.platform? :linux
      args.outputs.labels << { text: "I am running on Linux.", **label_style }
    elsif args.gtk.platform? :web
      args.outputs.labels << { text: "I am running on a web page.", **label_style }
    elsif args.gtk.platform? :android
      args.outputs.labels << { text: "I am running on Android.", **label_style }
    elsif args.gtk.platform? :ios
      args.outputs.labels << { text: "I am running on iOS.", **label_style }
    elsif args.gtk.platform? :touch
      args.outputs.labels << { text: "I am running on a device that supports touch (either iOS/Android native or mobile web).", **label_style }
    elsif args.gtk.platform? :steam
      args.outputs.labels << { text: "I am running via steam (covers both desktop and steamdeck).", **label_style }
    elsif args.gtk.platform? :steam_deck
      args.outputs.labels << { text: "I am running via steam on the Steam Deck (not steam desktop).", **label_style }
    elsif args.gtk.platform? :steam_desktop
      args.outputs.labels << { text: "I am running via steam on desktop (not steam deck).", **label_style }
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~production?~

Returns true if the game is being run in a released/shipped state.

If you want to simulate a production build. Add an empty file called ~dragonruby_production_build~ inside of the ~metadata~ folder. This will turn of all logging and all creation of temp files used for development purposes.

*** ~platform_mappings~

These are the current platform categorizations (~args.gtk.platform_mappings~):

#+begin_src ruby
  {
    "Mac OS X"   => [:desktop, :macos, :osx, :mac, :macosx], # may also include :steam and :steam_desktop run via steam
    "Windows"    => [:desktop, :windows, :win],              # may also include :steam and :steam_desktop run via steam
    "Linux"      => [:desktop, :linux, :nix],                # may also include :steam and :steam_desktop run via steam
    "Emscripten" => [:web, :wasm, :html, :emscripten],       # may also include :touch if running in the web browser on mobile
    "iOS"        => [:mobile, :ios, :touch],
    "Android"    => [:mobile, :android, :touch],
    "Steam Deck" => [:steamdeck, :steam_deck, :steam],
  }
#+end_src

Given the mappings above, ~args.gtk.platform? :desktop~ would return ~true~ if the game is running on a player's computer irrespective of OS (MacOS, Linux, and Windows are all categorized as ~:desktop~ platforms).


*** ~system~

NOTE:

 This function should only be used for debugging/development purposes and is not guaranteed to work cross platform. Do not use as a in-game feature in production.

Given an OS dependent cli command represented as a string, this function executes the command and ~puts~ the results to the DragonRuby Console (returns ~nil~).

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # execute ls on the current directory in 10 seconds
    if Kernel.tick_count == 600
      args.gtk.system "ls ."
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~exec~

NOTE:

 This function should only be used for debugging/development purposes and is not guaranteed to work cross platform. Do not use as a in-game feature in production.

Given an OS dependent cli command represented as a string, this function executes the command and returns a ~string~ representing the results.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # execute ls on the current directory in 10 seconds
    if Kernel.tick_count == 600
      results = args.gtk.exec "ls ."
      puts "The results of the command are:"
      puts results
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~show_cursor~

Shows the mouse cursor.

*** ~hide_cursor~

Hides the mouse cursor.

*** ~cursor_shown?~

Returns ~true~ if the mouse cursor is visible.

*** ~set_mouse_grab~

Takes in a numeric parameter representing the mouse grab mode.

-   ~0~: Ungrabs the mouse.
-   ~1~: Grabs the mouse.
-   ~2~: Hides the cursor, grabs the mouse and puts it in relative position mode accessible via ~args.inputs.mouse.relative_(x|y)~.

*** ~set_system_cursor~

Takes in a string value of ~"arrow"~, ~"ibeam"~, ~"wait"~, or ~"hand"~ and sets the mouse cursor to the corresponding system cursor (if available on the OS).

*** ~set_cursor~

Replaces the mouse cursor with a sprite. Takes in a ~path~ to the sprite, and optionally an ~x~ and ~y~ value representing the relative positioning the sprite will have to the mouse cursor.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    if Kernel.tick_count == 0
      # assumes a sprite of size 80x80 and centers the sprite
      # relative to the cursor position.
      args.gtk.set_cursor "sprites/square/blue.png", 40, 40
    end
  end
#+end_src

** File IO Functions

NOTE:

 File access functions are sandboxed and assume that the
~dragonruby~ binary lives alongside the game you are building. --Do not
expect these functions to return correct values if you are attempting
to run the ~dragonruby~ binary from a shared location--. It's --strongly--
recommended that the directory structure contained in the zip is not
altered and games are built using that starter template.

The following functions give you the ability to interact with the file system.

DragonRuby uses a sandboxed filesystem which will automatically read from and write to a location appropriate for your platform so you don't have to worry about theses details in your code. You can just use ~GTK.read_file~, ~GTK.write_file~, and ~GTK.append_file~ with a relative path and the engine will take care of the rest.

The data directories that will be written to in a production build are:
- Windows: ~C:\Users\YourWindowsUsername\AppData\Roaming\[devtitle]\[gametitle]~
- MacOS: ~$HOME/Library/Application Support/[gametitle]~
- Linux: ~$HOME/.local/share/[gametitle]~
- HTML5: The data will be written to the browser's IndexedDB.

The values in square brackets are the values you set in your ~app/metadata/game_metadata.txt~ file.

When reading files, the engine will first look in the game's data directory and then in the game directory itself. This means that if you write a file to the data directory that already exists in your game directory, the file in the data directory will be used instead of the one that is in your game.

When running a development build you will directly write to your game directory (and thus overwrite existing files). This can be useful for built-in development tools like level editors.

For more details on the implementation of the sandboxed filesystem, see Ryan C. Gordon's PhysicsFS documentation: [https://icculus.org/physfs/](https://icculus.org/physfs/)

*** ~list_files~

This function takes in one parameter. The parameter is the directory path and assumes the the game directory is the root. The method returns an ~Array~ of ~String~ representing all files within the directory. Use ~stat_file~ to determine whether a specific path is a file or a directory.

*** ~stat_file~

This function takes in one parameter. The parameter is the file path and assumes the the game directory is the root. The method returns ~nil~ if the file doesn't exist otherwise it returns a ~Hash~ with the following information:

#+begin_src ruby
  # {
  #   path: String,
  #   file_size: Int,
  #   mod_time: Int,
  #   create_time: Int,
  #   access_time: Int,
  #   readonly: Boolean,
  #   file_type: Symbol (:regular, :directory, :symlink, :other),
  # }
  
  def tick args
    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      args.gtk.write_file "last-mouse-click.txt", "Mouse was clicked at #{Kernel.tick_count}."
    end
  
    file_info = args.gtk.stat_file "last-mouse-click.txt"
  
    if file_info
      args.outputs.labels << {
        x: 30,
        y: 30.from_top,
        text: file_info.to_s,
        size_enum: -3
      }
    else
      args.outputs.labels << {
        x: 30,
        y: 30.from_top,
        text: "file does not exist, click to create file",
        size_enum: -3
      }
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~read_file~

Given a file path, a string will be returned representing the contents of the file. ~nil~ will be returned if the file does not exist. You can use ~stat_file~ to get additional information of a file.

*** ~write_file~

This function takes in two parameters. The first parameter is the file path and assumes the the game directory is the root. The second parameter is the string that will be written. The method ----overwrites---- whatever is currently in the file. Use ~append_file~ to append to the file as opposed to overwriting.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      args.gtk.write_file "last-mouse-click.txt", "Mouse was clicked at #{Kernel.tick_count}."
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~append_file~

This function takes in two parameters. The first parameter is the file path and assumes the the game directory is the root. The second parameter is the string that will be written. The method appends to whatever is currently in the file (a new file is created if one does not already exist). Use ~write_file~ to overwrite the file's contents as opposed to appending.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      args.gtk.append_file "click-history.txt", "Mouse was clicked at #{Kernel.tick_count}.\n"
      puts args.gtk.read_file("click-history.txt")
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~delete_file~

This function takes in a single parameters. The parameter is the file or directory path that should be deleted. This function will raise an exception if the path requesting to be deleted does not exist.

Here is a list of reasons an exception could be raised:

-   If the path is still open (for reading or writing).
-   If the path is not a file or directory.
-   If the path is a circular symlink.
-   If you do not have permissions to delete the path.
-   If the directory attempting to be deleted is not empty.

Notes:

-   Use ~stat_file~ to determine if a path exists.
-   Use ~list_files~ to determine if a directory is empty.
-   You cannot delete files outside of your sandboxed game environment.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    if args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.w
      # press w to write file
      args.gtk.append_file "example-file.txt", "File written at #{Kernel.tick_count}\n"
      args.gtk.notify "File written/appended."
    elsif args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.d
      # press d to delete file "unsafely"
      args.gtk.delete_file "example-file.txt"
      args.gtk.notify "File deleted."
    elsif args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.r
      # press r to read file
      contents = args.gtk.read_file "example-file.txt"
      args.gtk.notify "File contents written to console."
      puts contents
    end
  end
#+end_src


*** ~parse_json~

Given a json string, this function returns a hash representing the json data.

#+begin_src 
  hash = args.gtk.parse_json '{ "name": "John Doe", "aliases": ["JD"] }'
  # structure of hash: { "name"=>"John Doe", "aliases"=>["JD"] }
#+end_src

*** ~parse_json_file~

Same behavior as ~parse_json~ except a file path is read for the json string.

*** ~parse_xml~

Given xml data as a string, this function will return a hash that represents the xml data in the following recursive structure:

#+begin_src ruby
  {
    type: :element,
    name: "Person",
    children: [...]
  }
#+end_src

*** ~parse_xml_file~

Function has the same behavior as ~parse_xml~ except that the parameter must be a file path that contains xml contents.

** Network IO Functions

The following functions help with interacting with the network.

*** ~http_get~

Returns an object that represents an http response which will eventually have a value. This ~http_get~ method is invoked asynchronously. Check for completion before attempting to read results.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # perform an http get and print the response when available
    args.state.result ||= args.gtk.http_get "https://httpbin.org/html"
  
    if args.state.result && args.state.result[:complete] && !args.state.printed
      if args.state.result[:http_response_code] == 200
        puts "The response was successful. The body is:"
        puts args.state.result[:response_data]
      else
        puts "The response failed. Status code:"
        puts args.state.result[:http_response_code]
      end
      # set a flag denoting that the response has been printed
      args.state.printed = true
  
      # show the console
      args.gtk.show_console
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~http_post~

Returns an object that represents an http response which will eventually have a value. This ~http_post~ method is invoked asynchronously. Check for completion before attempting to read results.

-   First parameter: The url to send the request to.
-   Second parameter: Hash that represents form fields to send.
-   Third parameter: Headers. Note: Content-Type must be form encoded flavor. If you are unsure of what to pass in, set the content type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # perform an http get and print the response when available
  
    args.state.form_fields ||= { "userId" => "#{Time.now.to_i}" }
    args.state.result ||= args.gtk.http_post "http://httpbin.org/post",
                                             args.state.form_fields,
                                             ["Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"]
  
  
    if args.state.result && args.state.result[:complete] && !args.state.printed
      if args.state.result[:http_response_code] == 200
        puts "The response was successful. The body is:"
        puts args.state.result[:response_data]
      else
        puts "The response failed. Status code:"
        puts args.state.result[:http_response_code]
      end
      # set a flag denoting that the response has been printed
      args.state.printed = true
  
      # show the console
      args.gtk.show_console
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~http_post_body~

Returns an object that represents an http response which will eventually have a value. This ~http_post_body~ method is invoked asynchronously. Check for completion before attempting to read results.

-   First parameter: The url to send the request to.
-   Second parameter: String that represents the body that will be sent
-   Third parameter: Headers. Be sure to populate the Content-Type that matches the data you are sending.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # perform an http get and print the response when available
  
    args.state.json ||= "{ "userId": "#{Time.now.to_i}"}"
    args.state.result ||= args.gtk.http_post_body "http://httpbin.org/post",
                                                  args.state.json,
                                                  ["Content-Type: application/json", "Content-Length: #{args.state.json.length}"]
  
  
    if args.state.result && args.state.result[:complete] && !args.state.printed
      if args.state.result[:http_response_code] == 200
        puts "The response was successful. The body is:"
        puts args.state.result[:response_data]
      else
        puts "The response failed. Status code:"
        puts args.state.result[:http_response_code]
      end
      # set a flag denoting that the response has been printed
      args.state.printed = true
  
      # show the console
      args.gtk.show_console
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~start_server!~

Starts a in-game http server that can be process http requests. When your game is running in development mode. A dev server is started at ~http://localhost:9001~

?> You must set ~webserver.enabled=true~ in ~metadata/cvars.txt~ to view docs locally. These docs are also available under ~./docs~ within the zip file in markdown format.

You can start an in-game http server in production via:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # server explicitly enabled in production
    args.gtk.start_server! port: 9001, enable_in_prod: true
  end
#+end_src

Here's how you would respond to http requests:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # server explicitly enabled in production
    args.gtk.start_server! port: 9001, enable_in_prod: true
  
    # loop through pending requests and respond to them
    args.inputs.http_requests.each do |request|
      puts "#{request}"
      request.respond 200, "ok"
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~http_get~

Returns an object that represents an http response which will eventually have a value. This ~http_get~ method is invoked asynchronously. Check for completion before attempting to read results.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # perform an http get and print the response when available
    args.state.result ||= args.gtk.http_get "https://httpbin.org/html"
  
    if args.state.result && args.state.result[:complete] && !args.state.printed
      if args.state.result[:http_response_code] == 200
        puts "The response was successful. The body is:"
        puts args.state.result[:response_data]
      else
        puts "The response failed. Status code:"
        puts args.state.result[:http_response_code]
      end
      # set a flag denoting that the response has been printed
      args.state.printed = true
  
      # show the console
      args.gtk.show_console
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~http_post~

Returns an object that represents an http response which will eventually have a value. This ~http_post~ method is invoked asynchronously. Check for completion before attempting to read results.

-   First parameter: The url to send the request to.
-   Second parameter: Hash that represents form fields to send.
-   Third parameter: Headers. Note: Content-Type must be form encoded flavor. If you are unsure of what to pass in, set the content type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded

#+begin_src ruby

    if args.state.result && args.state.result[:complete] && !args.state.printed
      if args.state.result[:http_response_code] == 200
        puts "The response was successful. The body is:"
        puts args.state.result[:response_data]
      else
        puts "The response failed. Status code:"
        puts args.state.result[:http_response_code]
      end
      # set a flag denoting that the response has been printed
      args.state.printed = true
  
      # show the console
      args.gtk.show_console
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~http_post_body~

Returns an object that represents an http response which will eventually have a value. This ~http_post_body~ method is invoked asynchronously. Check for completion before attempting to read results.

-   First parameter: The url to send the request to.
-   Second parameter: String that represents the body that will be sent
-   Third parameter: Headers. Be sure to populate the Content-Type that matches the data you are sending.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # perform an http get and print the response when available
  
    args.state.json ||= "{ "userId": "#{Time.now.to_i}"}"
    args.state.result ||= args.gtk.http_post_body "http://httpbin.org/post",
                                                  args.state.json,
                                                  ["Content-Type: application/json", "Content-Length: #{args.state.json.length}"]
  
  
    if args.state.result && args.state.result[:complete] && !args.state.printed
      if args.state.result[:http_response_code] == 200
        puts "The response was successful. The body is:"
        puts args.state.result[:response_data]
      else
        puts "The response failed. Status code:"
        puts args.state.result[:http_response_code]
      end
      # set a flag denoting that the response has been printed
      args.state.printed = true
  
      # show the console
      args.gtk.show_console
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~start_server!~

Starts a in-game http server that can be process http requests. When your game is running in development mode. A dev server is started at ~http://localhost:9001~

?> You must set ~webserver.enabled=true~ in ~metadata/cvars.txt~ to view docs locally. These docs are also available under ~./docs~ within the zip file in markdown format.

You can start an in-game http server in production via:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # server explicitly enabled in production
    args.gtk.start_server! port: 9001, enable_in_prod: true
  end
#+end_src

Here's how you would respond to http requests:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # server explicitly enabled in production
    args.gtk.start_server! port: 9001, enable_in_prod: true
  
    # loop through pending requests and respond to them
    args.inputs.http_requests.each do |request|
      puts "#{request}"
      request.respond 200, "ok"
    end
  end
#+end_src

** Developer Support Functions

The following functions help support the development process. It is not recommended to use this functions in "production" game logic.

*** ~version~

Returns a string representing the version of DragonRuby you are running.

*** ~version_pro?~

Returns ~true~ if the version of DragonRuby is NOT Standard Edition.

*** ~game_version~

Returns a version string within ~mygame/game_metadata.txt~.

To get other values from ~mygame/game_metadata.txt~, you can do:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    if Kernel.tick_count == 0
      puts args.gtk.game_version
      args.cvars["game_metadata.version"].value
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~reset~

This function will be called if ~GTK.reset~ is invoked. It will be called before DragonRuby resets game state and
is useful for capturing state information before a reset occurs (you can use this override to reset state external
to DragonRuby's ~args.state~ construct).

#+begin_src ruby
  # class that handles your game loop
  class MyGame
    attr :foo
  
    # initialization method that sets member variables
    # external to args.state
    def initialize args
      puts "initializing game"
      @foo = 0
      args.state.bar ||= 0
    end
  
    # game logic
    def tick args
      args.state.bar += 1
      @foo += 1
      args.outputs.labels << {
        x: 640,
        y: 360,
        text: "#{$game.foo}, #{args.state.bar}"
      }
    end
  end
  
  def tick args
    # initialize global game variable if it's nil
    $game ||= MyGame.new(args)
  
    # run tick
    $game.tick args
  
    # at T=600, invoke reset
    if Kernel.tick_count == 600
      GTK.reset
    end
  end
  
  # this function will be invoked before
  # GTK.reset occurs
  def reset args
    puts "resetting"
    puts "foo is: #{$game.foo}"
    puts "bar is: #{args.state.bar}"
    puts "tick count: #{Kernel.tick_count}"
  
    # reset global game to nil so that it will be re-initialized next tick
    $game = nil
  end
#+end_src

*** ~reset_next_tick~

Has the same behavior as ~reset~ except the reset occurs before ~tick~ is executed again. ~reset~ resets the environment immediately (while the ~tick~ method is in-flight). It's recommended that ~reset~ should be called outside of the tick method (invoked when a file is saved/hotloaded), and ~reset_next_tick~ be used inside of the ~tick~ method so you don't accidentally blow away state the your game depends on to complete the current ~tick~ without exceptions.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # reset the game if "r" is pressed on the keyboard
    if args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.r
      args.gtk.reset_next_tick # use reset_next_tick instead of reset
    end
  end
  
  # reset the game if this file is hotloaded/required
  # (removes the need to press "r" when I file is updated)
  GTK.reset
#+end_src

*** ~reset_sprite~

Sprites when loaded are cached. Given a string parameter, this method invalidates the cache record of a sprite so that updates on from the disk can be loaded.

This function can also be used to delete/garbage collect render targets you are no longer using.

*** ~reset_sprites~

Sprites when loaded are cached. This method invalidates the cache record of all sprites so that updates on from the disk can be loaded. This function is automatically called when ~args.gtk.reset~ (~GTK.reset~) is invoked.

*** ~calcspritebox~

NOTE:

 This method should be used for development purposes only and is expensive to call every frame. Do not use this method to set the size of sprite when rendering (hard code those values since you know what they are beforehand).

Given a path to a sprite, this method returns the ~width~ and ~height~ of a sprite as a tuple.

*** ~current_framerate~

Returns a float value representing the framerate of your game. This is an approximation/moving average of your framerate and should eventually settle to 60fps.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # render a label to the screen that shows the current framerate
    # formatted as a floating point number with two decimal places
    args.outputs.labels << { x: 30, y: 30.from_top, text: "#{args.gtk.current_framerate.to_sf}" }
  end
#+end_src

*** ~framerate_diagnostics_primitives~

Returns a set of primitives that can be rendered to the screen which provide more detailed information about the speed of your simulation (framerate, draw call count, mouse position, etc).

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.primitives << args.gtk.framerate_diagnostics_primitives
  end
#+end_src

*** ~warn_array_primitives!~

This function helps you audit your game of usages of array-based primitives. While array-based primitives are simple to create and use, they are slower to process than ~Hash~ or ~Class~ based primitives.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # enable array based primitives warnings
    args.gtk.warn_array_primitives!
  
    # array-based primitive elsewhere in code
    # an log message will be posted giving the location of the array
    # based primitive usage
    args.outputs.sprites << [100, 100, 200, 200, "sprites/square/blue.png"]
  
    # instead of using array based primitives, migrate to hashes as needed
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 100,
      y: 100,
      w: 200,
      h: 200, path:
      "sprites/square/blue.png"
    }
  end
#+end_src

*** ~benchmark~

You can use this function to compare the relative performance of blocks of code.

Function takes in either ~iterations~ or ~seconds~ along with a collection of ~lambdas~.

If ~iterations~ is provided, the winner will be determined by the fastest completion time.

If ~seconds~ is provided, the winner will be determined by the most completed iterations.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # press i to run benchmark using iterations
    if args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.i
      args.gtk.console.show
      args.gtk.benchmark iterations: 1000, # number of iterations
                         # label for experiment
                         using_numeric_map: -> () {
                           # experiment body
                           v = 100.map_with_index do |i|
                             i * 100
                           end
                         },
                         # label for experiment
                         using_numeric_times: -> () {
                           # experiment body
                           v = []
                           100.times do |i|
                             v << i * 100
                           end
                         }
    end
  
    # press s to run benchmark using seconds
    if args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.s
      args.gtk.console.show
      args.gtk.benchmark seconds: 1, # number of seconds to run each experiment
                         # label for experiment
                         using_numeric_map: -> () {
                           # experiment body
                           v = 100.map_with_index do |i|
                             i * 100
                           end
                         },
                         # label for experiment
                         using_numeric_times: -> () {
                           # experiment body
                           v = []
                           100.times do |i|
                             v << i * 100
                           end
                         }
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~notify!~

Given a string, this function will present a message at the bottom of your game. This method is only invoked in dev mode and is useful for debugging.

An optional parameter of duration (number value representing ticks) can also be passed in. The default value if ~300~ ticks (5 seconds).

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      args.gtk.notify! "Mouse was clicked!"
    end
  
    if args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.r
      # optional duration parameter
      args.gtk.notify! "R key was pressed!", 600 # present message for 10 seconds/600 frames
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~notify_extended!~

Has similar behavior as notify! except you have additional options to show messages in a production environment.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      args.gtk.notify_extended! message: "message",
                                duration: 300,
                                env: :prod
    end
  end
#+end_src

*** ~slowmo!~

Given a numeric value representing the factor of 60fps. This function will bring your simulation loop down to slower rate. This method is intended to be used for debugging purposes.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # set your simulation speed to (15 fps): args.gtk.slowmo! 4
    # set your simulation speed to (1 fps): args.gtk.slowmo! 60
    # set your simulation speed to (30 fps):
    args.gtk.slowmo! 2
  end
#+end_src

Remove this line from your tick method will automatically set your simulation speed back to 60 fps.

*** ~show_console~

Shows the DragonRuby console. Useful when debugging/customizing an in-game dev workflow.

*** ~hide_console~

Hides the DragonRuby console. Useful when debugging/customizing an in-game dev workflow.

*** ~enable_console~

Enables the DragonRuby Console so that it can be presented by pressing the tilde key (the key next to the number 1 key).

*** ~disable_console~

Disables the DragonRuby Console so that it won't show up even if you press the tilde key or call ~args.gtk.show_console~.

*** ~disable_reset_via_ctrl_r~

By default, pressing ~CTRL+R~ invokes ~GTK.reset_next_tick~ (safely resetting your game with a convenient key combo).

If you want to disable this behavior, add the following to the ~main.rb~:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    ...
  end
  
  GTK.disable_reset_via_ctrl_r
#+end_src

NOTE: ~GTK.disable_console~ will also disable the ~CTRL+R~ reset behavior.

*** ~disable_controller_config~

DragonRuby has a built-in controller configuration/mapping wizard. You can disable this wizard by adding ~GTK.disable_controller_config~ at the top of main.rb.

*** ~enable_controller_config~

DragonRuby has a built-in controller configuration/mapping wizard. You can re-enable this wizard by adding ~GTK.enable_controller_config~ at the top of main.rb (this is enabled by default).

*** ~start_recording~

Resets the game to tick ~0~ and starts recording gameplay. Useful for visual regression tests/verification.

*** ~stop_recording~

Function takes in a destination file for the currently recording gameplay. This file can be used to replay a recording.

*** ~cancel_recording~

Function cancels a gameplay recording session and discards the replay.

*** ~start_replay~

Given a file that represents a recording, this method will run the recording against the current codebase.

You can start a replay from the command line also:

#+begin_src bash
  # first argument: the game directory
  # --replay switch is the file path relative to the game directory
  # --speed switch is optional. a value of 4 will run the replay and game at 4x speed
  # cli command example is in the context of Linux and Mac, for Windows the binary would be ./dragonruby.exe
  ./dragonruby ./mygame --replay replay.txt --speed 4
#+end_src

*** ~stop_replay~

Function stops a replay that is currently executing.

*** ~get_base_dir~

Returns the path to the location of the dragonruby binary. In production mode, this value will be the same as the value returned by ~get_game_dir~. Function should only be used for debugging/development workflows.

*** ~get_game_dir~

Returns the location within sandbox storage that the game is running. When developing your game, this value will be your ~mygame~ directory. In production, it'll return a value that is OS specific (eg the Roaming directory on Windows or the Application Support directory on Mac).

Invocations of ~(write|append)_file~ will write to this sandboxed directory.

*** ~get_game_dir_url~

Returns a url encoded string representing the sandbox location for game data.

*** ~open_game_dir~

Opens the game directory in the OS's file explorer. This should be used for debugging purposes only.

*** ~write_file_root~

Given a file path and contents, the contents will be written to a directory outside of the game directory. This method should be used for development purposes only. In production this method will write to the same sandboxed location as ~write_file~.

*** ~append_file_root~

Has the same behavior as ~write_file_root~ except that it appends the contents as opposed to overwriting them.

*** ~argv~

Returns a string representing the command line arguments passed to the DragonRuby binary. This should be used for development/debugging purposes only.

*** ~cli_arguments~

Returns a ~Hash~ for command line arguments in the format of ~--switch value~ (two hyphens preceding the switch flag with the value separated by a space). This should be used for development/debugging purposes only.

*** ~download_stb_rb(_raw)~

These two functions can help facilitate the integration of external code files. OSS contributors are encouraged to create libraries that all fit in one file (lowering the barrier to entry for adoption).

Examples:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
  end
  
  # option 1:
  # source code will be downloaded from the specified GitHub url, and saved locally with a
  # predefined folder convention.
  GTK.download_stb_rb "https://github.com/xenobrain/ruby_vectormath/blob/main/vectormath_2d.rb"
  
  # option 2:
  # source code will be downloaded from the specified GitHub username, repository, and file.
  # code will be saved locally with a predefined folder convention.
  GTK.download_stb_rb "xenobrain", "ruby_vectormath", "vectormath_2d.rb"
  
  # option 3:
  # source code will be downloaded from a direct/raw url and saved to a direct/raw local path.
  GTK.download_stb_rb_raw "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenobrain/ruby_vectormath/main/vectormath_2d.rb",
                           "lib/xenobrain/ruby_vectionmath/vectormath_2d.rb"
#+end_src

*** ~reload_history~

Returns a ~Hash~ representing the code files that have be loaded for your game along with timings for the events. This should be used for development/debugging purposes only.

*** ~reload_history_pending~

Returns a ~Hash~ for files that have been queued for reload, but haven't been processed yet. This should be used for development/debugging purposes only.

*** ~reload_if_needed~

Given a file name, this function will queue the file for reload if it's been modified. An optional second parameter can be passed in to signify if the file should be forced loaded regardless of modified time (~true~ means to force load, ~false~ means to load only if the file has been modified). This function should be used for development/debugging purposes only.

* State (~args.state~)

Store your game state inside of this ~state~. Properties with arbitrary nesting is allowed and a backing Entity will be created on your behalf.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.player.x ||= 0
    args.state.player.y ||= 0
  end
#+end_src

** ~entity_id~

Entities automatically receive an ~entity_id~ of type ~Fixnum~.

** ~entity_type~

Entities can have an ~entity_type~ which is represented as a ~Symbol~.

** ~created_at~

Entities have ~created_at~ set to ~Kernel.tick_count~ when they are created.

** ~created_at_elapsed~

Returns the elapsed number of ticks since creation.

** ~global_created_at~

Entities have ~global_created_at~ set to ~Kernel.global_tick_count~ when they are created.

** ~global_created_at_elapsed~

Returns the elapsed number of global ticks since creation.

** ~as_hash~

Entity cast to a ~Hash~ so you can update values as if you were updating a ~Hash~.

** ~tick_count~

Returns the current tick of the game. ~Kernel.tick_count~ is ~0~ when the game is first started or if the game is reset via ~GTK.reset~.

* Geometry

The Geometry ~module~ contains methods for calculations that are frequently used in game development.

The following functions of ~Geometry~ are mixed into ~Hash~, ~Array~, and DragonRuby's ~Entity~ class:

- ~intersect_rect?~
- ~inside_rect?~
- ~scale_rect~
- ~angle_to~
- ~angle_from~
- ~point_inside_circle?~
- ~center_inside_rect~
- ~center_inside_rect_x~
- ~center_inside_rect_y~
- ~anchor_rect~
- ~rect_center_point~

You can invoke the functions above using either the mixin variant or the module variant. Example:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # define to rectangles
    rect_1 = { x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100 }
    rect_2 = { x: 50, y: 50, w: 100, h: 100 }
  
    # mixin variant
    # call geometry method function from instance of a Hash class
    puts rect_1.intersect_rect?(rect_2)
  
    # OR
  
    # module variants
    puts args.geometry.intersect_rect?(rect_1, rect_2)
    puts Geometry.intersect_rect?(rect_1, rect_2)
  end
#+end_src







































* CVars / Configuration (~args.cvars~)

Hash contains metadata pulled from the files under the ~./metadata~ directory. To get the keys that are available type ~$args.cvars.keys~ in the Console. Here is an example of how to retrieve the game version number:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.labels << {
      x: 640,
      y: 360,
      text: args.cvars["game_metadata.version"].value.to_s
    }
  end
#+end_src

Each CVar has the following properties ~value~, ~name~, ~description~, ~type~, ~locked~.

** Available Configuration

?> See ~metadata/game_metadata.txt~ and ~metadata/cvars.txt~ for detailed information of all the configuration values that are supported. The following table
is a high level summary of each value.

* Layout

Layout provides apis for placing primitives on a virtual grid that's
within the "safe area" accross all platforms. This virtual grid is
useful for rendering static controls (buttons, menu items,
configuration screens, etc).

?> All functions are available globally via ~Layout.-~.
#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
     puts args.layout.function(...)
  
     # OR available globally
     puts Layout.function(...)
  end
#+end_src

For reference implementations, take a look at the following sample apps:

-   ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/18_layouts~
-   ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering_hd/04_layouts_and_portrait_mode~
-   ~./samples/99_genre_rpg_turn_based/turn_based_battle~

The following example creates two menu items and updates a label with the button that was clicked:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # render debug_primitives of args.layout for help with placement
    # args.outputs.primitives << args.layout.debug_primitives
  
    # capture the location for a label centered at the top
    args.state.label_rect ||= args.layout.rect(row: 0, col: 10, w: 4, h: 1)
    # state variable to hold the current click status
    args.state.label_message ||= "click a menu item"
  
    # capture the location of two menu items positioned in the center
    # with a cell width of 4 and cell height of 2
    args.state.menu_item_1_rect ||= args.layout.rect(row: 1, col: 10, w: 4, h: 2)
    args.state.menu_item_2_rect ||= args.layout.rect(row: 3, col: 10, w: 4, h: 2)
  
    # render the label at the center of the label_rect
    args.outputs.labels << args.state.label_rect.center.merge(text: args.state.label_message,
                                                              anchor_x: 0.5,
                                                              anchor_y: 0.5)
  
    # render menu items
    args.outputs.sprites << args.state.menu_item_1_rect.merge(path: :solid,
                                                              r: 100,
                                                              g: 100,
                                                              b: 200)
    args.outputs.labels << args.state.menu_item_1_rect.center.merge(text: "item 1",
                                                                    r: 255,
                                                                    g: 255,
                                                                    b: 255,
                                                                    anchor_x: 0.5,
                                                                    anchor_y: 0.5)
  
    args.outputs.sprites << args.state.menu_item_2_rect.merge(path: :solid,
                                                              r: 100,
                                                              g: 100,
                                                              b: 200)
    args.outputs.labels << args.state.menu_item_2_rect.center.merge(text: "item 2",
                                                                    r: 255,
                                                                    g: 255,

                                                                    anchor_x: 0.5,
                                                                    anchor_y: 0.5)
  
    # if click occurs, then determine which menu item was clicked
    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      if args.inputs.mouse.intersect_rect?(args.state.menu_item_1_rect)
        args.state.label_message = "menu item 1 clicked"
      elsif args.inputs.mouse.intersect_rect?(args.state.menu_item_2_rect)
        args.state.label_message = "menu item 2 clicked"
      else
        args.state.label_message = "click a menu item"
      end
    end
  end
#+end_src

** ~rect~

Given a ~row:~, ~col:~, ~w:~, ~h:~, returns a ~Hash~ with properties ~x~, ~y~, ~w~, ~h~, and ~center~ (which contains a ~Hash~ with ~x~, ~y~). The virtual grid is 12 rows by 24 columns (or 24 columns by 12 rows in portrait mode).

** ~debug_primitives~

Function returns an array of primitives that can be rendered to the screen to help you place items within the grid.

Example:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    ...
  
    # at the end of tick method, render the
    # grid overlay to static_primitives on
    # tick_count=0 to help with positioning
    if Kernel.tick_count == 0
      # Layout.debug_primitives returns a flat hash of values
      # so you can customize the colors/alphas if needed
      # args.outputs.static_primitives << Layout.debug_primitives.map do |primitive|
      #   primitive.merge(r: ..., g: ..., b: ..., etc)
      # end
      args.outputs.static_primitives << Layout.debug_primitives
    end
  end
#+end_src

* Grid

Provides information about the screen and game canvas.

?> All functions are available globally via ~Grid.-~.
#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
     puts args.grid.function(...)
  
     # OR available globally
     puts Grid.function(...)
  end
#+end_src

** ~orientation~

Returns either ~:landscape~ (default) or ~:portrait~. The orientation of your game is set within ~./mygame/metadata/game_metadata.txt~.

** ~origin_name~

Returns either ~:bottom_left~ (default) or ~:center~.

** ~origin_bottom_left!~

Change the grids coordinate system where ~0, 0~ is at the bottom left
corner. ~origin_name~ will be set to ~:bottom_left~.

** ~origin_center!~

Change the grids coordinate system where ~0, 0~ is at the center of the
screen. ~origin_name~ will be set to ~:center~.

** ~portrait?~

Returns ~true~ if ~orientation~ is ~:portrait~.

** ~landscape?~

Returns ~true~ if ~orientation~ is ~:landscape~.

** Grid Property Categorizations

There are two categories of Grid properties that you should be aware of:

- Logical: Values are represented at the logical scale of ~720p~
  (1280x720 for landscape orientation or 720x1280 portrait mode).
- Pixels: Values are represented in the context of Pixels for a given display.

NOTE:

 You will almost always use the Logical Category's properties.




The Pixel is helpful for sanity checking of Texture Atlases, creating
C Extensions, and Shaders (Indie and Pro License features).




For the Standard License, the Pixel Category
properties will all return values from the Logical Category.

Here's an example of what the property conventions look like:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # Logical width
    args.grid.w
  
    # Width in pixels
    args.grid.w_px
  end
#+end_src

Note: ~Grid~ properties are globally accessible via ~$grid~.

NOTE:

 All Grid properties that follow take ~origin_name~, and ~orientation~ into consideration.

** ~bottom~

Returns value that represents the bottom of the grid.

Given that the logical canvas is ~720p~, these are the values that
~bottom~ may return:

- origin: ~:bottom_left~, orientation: ~:landscape~: ~0~
- origin: ~:bottom_left~, orientation: ~:portrait~: ~0~
- origin: ~:center~, orientation: ~:landscape~: ~-360~
- origin: ~:center~, orientation: ~:portrait~: ~-640~

** ~top~

Returns value that represents the top of the grid.

** ~left~

Returns value that represents the left of the grid.

** ~right~

Returns the ~x~ value that represents the right of the grid.

** ~rect~

Returns a rectangle Primitive that represents the grid.

** ~w~

Returns the grid's width.

** ~h~

Returns the grid's width.

** ~aspect_ratio_w~

Returns either ~16~ or ~9~ based on orientation.

** ~aspect_ratio_h~

Returns either ~16~ or ~9~ based on orientation.

** HD, HighDPI, and All Screen Modes

The following properties are available to Pro License holders. These
features are enabled via ~./mygame/metadata/game_metadata.txt~:

- ~hd=true~: Enable Texture Atlases and HD label/font rendering. Grid
  properties in the Pixel Category will reflect true values instead of values
  from the Logical Category.
- ~highdpi=true~: HD must be enabled before this property will be
   respected. Texture Atlas selection and label/font rendering
   takes into consideration the hardware's resolution/rendering
   capabilities.
- ~hd_letterbox=false~: Removes the game's 16:9 letterbox, allowing
  you to render edge to edge (All Screen). Game content will be
  centered within the 16:9 safe area.

NOTE:

 For a demonstration of these configurations/property usages, see: ~./samples/07_advanced_rendering/03_allscreen_properties~.

When All Screen mode is enabled (~hd_letterbox=false~), you can render
outside of the 1280x720 safe area. The 1280x720 logical canvas will be
centered within the screen and scaled to one of the following
closest/best-fit resolutions.

-   720p: 1280x720
-   HD+: 1600x900
-   1080p: 1920x1080
-   1440p: 2560x1440
-   1880p: 3200x1800
-   4k: 3840x2160
-   5k: 6400x2880

*** All Screen Properties

These properties provide dimensions of the screen outside of the 16:9
safe area as logical ~720p~ values.

- ~allscreen_left~
- ~allscreen_right~
- ~allscreen_top~
- ~allscreen_bottom~
- ~allscreen_w~
- ~allscreen_h~
- ~allscreen_offset_x~
- ~allscreen_offset_y~

NOTE:

 With the main canvas being centered in the screen, ~allscreen_left~
and ~allscreen_bottom~ may return negative numbers for origin
~:bottom_left~ since ~x: 0, y: 0~ might not align with the bottom left border of the game window.

NOTE:

 It is strongly recommended that you don't use All Screen properties
for any elements the player would interact with (eg buttons in an
options menu) as they could get rendered underneath a "notch" on a
mobile device or at the far edge of an ultrawide display.

**** Logical, Point, Pixel Category Value Comparisons

NOTE:

 Reminder: it's unlikely that you'll use any of the
~_px~ variants. The explanation that follows if for those
that want the nitty gritty details.

*** Texture Atlases

*** ~native_scale~

Represents the native scale of the window compared to 720p.

*** ~render_scale~

Represents the render scale of the window compared to 720p. This value
will be the same as ~native_scale~ if ~game_metadata.hd_max_scale=0~
(stretch to fit). For values ~100 through 400~, the ~render_scale~
represents the best fit scale to render pixel perfect. See CVars /
Configuration (~args.cvars~), and ~metadata/game_metadata.txt~ for
details about ~hd_max_scale~'s usage.

*** ~texture_scale~

Returns a decimal value representing the rendering scale for textures as a float.

-   720p: 1.0
-   HD+: 1.25
-   1080p, Full HD: 1.5
-   Full HD+: 1.75
-   1440p: 2.0
-   1880p: 2.5
-   4k: 3.0
-   5k: 4.0

*** ~texture_scale_enum~

Returns an integer value representing the rendering scale of the game
at a best-fit value. For example, given a render scale of 2.7, the
textures atlas that will be selected will be 1880p (enum_value ~250~).

-   720p: 100
-   HD+: 125
-   1080p, Full HD: 150
-   Full HD+: 175
-   1440p: 200
-   1880p: 250
-   4k: 300
-   5k: 400

Given the following code:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.sprites << { x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100, path: "sprites/player.png" }
  end
#+end_src

The sprite path of ~sprites/player.png~ will be replaced according to
the following naming conventions (fallback to a lower resolution is
automatically handled if a sprite with naming convention isn't found):

-   720p: ~sprites/player.png~ (100x100)
-   HD+: ~sprites/player@125.png~ (125x125)
-   1080p: ~sprites/player@150.png~ (150x150)
-   1440p: ~sprites/player@200.png~ (200x200)
-   1880p: ~sprites/player@250.png~ (250x250)
-   4k: ~sprites/player@300.png~ (300x300)
-   5k: ~sprites/player@400.png~ (400x400)
* Array

The Array class has been extend to provide methods that will help in common game development tasks. Array is one of the most powerful classes in Ruby and a very fundamental component of Game Toolkit.

** ~map_2d~

Assuming the array is an array of arrays, Given a block, each 2D array index invoked against the block. A 2D array is a common way to store data/layout for a stage.

#+begin_src ruby
  repl do
    stage = [
      [:enemy, :empty, :player],
      [:empty, :empty,  :empty],
      [:enemy, :empty,  :enemy],
    ]
  
    occupied_tiles = stage.map_2d do |row, col, tile|
      if tile == :empty
        nil
      else
        [row, col, tile]
      end
    end.reject_nil
  
    puts "Stage:"
    puts stage
  
    puts "Occupied Tiles"
    puts occupied_tiles
  end
#+end_src

** ~include_any?~

Given a collection of items, the function will return
~true~ if any of ~self~'s items exists in the collection of items passed in:

#+begin_src
  l1 = [:a, :b, :c]
  result = l1.include_any?(:b, :c, :d)
  puts result # true

  l1 = [:a, :b, :c]
  l2 = [:b, :c, :d]
  # returns true, but requires the parameter to be "splatted"
  # consider using (l1 & l2) instead
  result = l1.include_any?(*l2)
  puts result # true

  # & (bit-wise and) operator usage
  l1 = [:a, :b, :c]
  l2 = [:d, :c]
  result = (l1 & l2)
  puts result # [:c]

  # | (bit-wise or) operator usage
  l1 = [:a, :b, :c, :a]
  l2 = [:d, :f, :a]
  result = l1 | l2
  puts result # [:d, :f, :a, :b, :c]
#+end_src

** ~any_intersect_rect?~

Assuming the array contains objects that respond to ~left~, ~right~, ~top~, ~bottom~, this method returns ~true~ if any of the elements within the array intersect the object being passed in. You are given an optional parameter called ~tolerance~ which informs how close to the other rectangles the elements need to be for it to be considered intersecting.

The default tolerance is set to ~0.1~, which means that the primitives are not considered intersecting unless they are overlapping by more than ~0.1~.

#+begin_src ruby
  repl do
    # Here is a player class that has position and implement
    # the ~attr_rect~ contract.
    class Player
      attr_rect
      attr_accessor :x, :y, :w, :h
  
      def initialize x, y, w, h
        @x = x
        @y = y
        @w = w
        @h = h
      end
  
      def serialize
        { x: @x, y: @y, w: @w, h: @h }
      end
  
      def inspect
        "#{serialize}"
      end
  
      def to_s
        "#{serialize}"
      end
    end
  
    # Here is a definition of two walls.
    walls = [
       [10, 10, 10, 10],
       { x: 20, y: 20, w: 10, h: 10 },
     ]
  
    # Display the walls.
    puts "Walls."
    puts walls
    puts ""
  
    # Check any_intersect_rect? on player
    player = Player.new 30, 20, 10, 10
    puts "Is Player #{player} touching wall?"
    puts (walls.any_intersect_rect? player)
    # => false
    # The value is false because of the default tolerance is 0.1.
    # The overlap of the player rect and any of the wall rects is
    # less than 0.1 (for those that intersect).
    puts ""
  
    player = Player.new 9, 10, 10, 10
    puts "Is Player #{player} touching wall?"
    puts (walls.any_intersect_rect? player)
    # => true
    puts ""
  end
#+end_src

** ~map_2d~

Assuming the array is an array of arrays, Given a block, each 2D array index invoked against the block. A 2D array is a common way to store data/layout for a stage.

#+begin_src ruby
  repl do
    stage = [
      [:enemy, :empty, :player],
      [:empty, :empty,  :empty],
      [:enemy, :empty,  :enemy],
    ]
  
    occupied_tiles = stage.map_2d do |row, col, tile|
      if tile == :empty
        nil
      else
        [row, col, tile]
      end
    end.reject_nil
  
    puts "Stage:"
    puts stage
  
    puts "Occupied Tiles"
    puts occupied_tiles
  end
#+end_src

** ~each~

The function, given a block, invokes the block for each item in the ~Array~. ~Array#each~ is synonymous to for each constructs in other languages.

Example of using ~Array#each~ in conjunction with ~args.state~ and ~args.outputs.sprites~ to render sprites to the screen:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    # define the colors of the rainbow in ~args.state~
    # as an ~Array~ of ~Hash~es with :order and :name.
    # :order will be used to determine render location
    #  and :name will be used to determine sprite path.
    args.state.rainbow_colors ||= [
      { order: 0, name: :red    },
      { order: 1, name: :orange },
      { order: 2, name: :yellow },
      { order: 3, name: :green  },
      { order: 4, name: :blue   },
      { order: 5, name: :indigo },
      { order: 6, name: :violet },
    ]
  
    # render sprites diagonally to the screen
    # with a width and height of 50.
    args.state
        .rainbow_colors
        .each do |color| # <-- ~Array#each~ usage
          args.outputs.sprites << [
            color[:order] * 50,
            color[:order] * 50,
            50,
            50,
            "sprites/square-#{color[:name]}.png"
          ]
        end
  end
#+end_src

** ~reject_nil~

Returns an ~Enumerable~ rejecting items that are ~nil~, this is an alias for ~Array#compact~:

#+begin_src ruby
  repl do
    a = [1, nil, 4, false, :a]
    puts a.reject_nil
    # => [1, 4, false, :a]
    puts a.compact
    # => [1, 4, false, :a]
  end
#+end_src

** ~reject_false~

Returns an \~Enumerable\~ rejecting items that are \~nil\~ or \~false\~.

#+begin_src ruby
  repl do
    a = [1, nil, 4, false, :a]
    puts a.reject_false
    # => [1, 4, :a]
  end
#+end_src

** ~product~

Returns all combinations of values between two arrays.

Here are some examples of using ~product~. Paste the following code at the bottom of main.rb and save the file to see the results:

#+begin_src ruby
  repl do
    a = [0, 1]
    puts a.product
    # => [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]
  end
#+end_src

#+begin_src ruby
  repl do
    a = [ 0,  1]
    b = [:a, :b]
    puts a.product b
    # => [[0, :a], [0, :b], [1, :a], [1, :b]]
  end
#+end_src
* ~Numeric~

The ~Numeric~ class has been extend to provide methods that
will help in common game development tasks.


** ~frame_index~

This function is helpful for determining the index of frame-by-frame
  sprite animation. The numeric value ~self~ represents the moment the
  animation started.

~frame_index~ takes three additional parameters:

- How many frames exist in the sprite animation.
- How long to hold each animation for.
- Whether the animation should repeat.

~frame_index~ will return ~nil~ if the time for the animation is out
of bounds of the parameter specification.

Example using variables:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    start_looping_at = 0
    number_of_sprites = 6
    number_of_frames_to_show_each_sprite = 4
    does_sprite_loop = true

    sprite_index =
      start_looping_at.frame_index number_of_sprites,
                                   number_of_frames_to_show_each_sprite,
                                   does_sprite_loop

    sprite_index ||= 0

    args.outputs.sprites << [
      640 - 50,
      360 - 50,
      100,
      100,
      "sprites/dragon-#{sprite_index}.png"
    ]
  end
#+end_src

Example using named parameters. The named parameters version allows you to
also specify a ~repeat_index~ which is useful if your animation has starting
frames that shouldn't be considered when looped:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    start_looping_at = 0

    sprite_index =
      start_looping_at.frame_index count: 6,
                                   hold_for: 4,
                                   repeat: true,
                                   repeat_index: 0,
                                   tick_count_override: Kernel.tick_count

    sprite_index ||= 0

    args.outputs.sprites << [
      640 - 50,
      360 - 50,
      100,
      100,
      "sprites/dragon-#{sprite_index}.png"
    ]
  end
#+end_src

The named parameter variant of ~frame_index~ is also available on ~Numeric~:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    sprite_index =
      Numeric.frame_index start_at: 0,
                          count: 6, # or frame_count: 6 (if both are provided frame_count will be used)
                          hold_for: 4,
                          repeat: true,
                          repeat_index: 0,
                          tick_count_override: Kernel.tick_count

    sprite_index ||= 0

    args.outputs.sprites << [
      640 - 50,
      360 - 50,
      100,
      100,
      "sprites/dragon-#{sprite_index}.png"
    ]
  end
#+end_src

Another example where ~frame_index~ is applied to a sprite sheet.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    index = Numeric.frame_index start_at: 0,
                                frame_count: 7,
                                repeat: true
    args.outputs.sprites << {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      w: 32,
      h: 32,
      source_x: 32 * index,
      source_y: 0,
      source_w: 32,
      source_h: 32,
      path: "sprites/misc/explosion-sheet.png"
    }
  end
#+end_src


** ~elapsed_time~
For a given number, the elapsed frames since that number is returned.
`Kernel.tick_count` is used to determine how many frames have elapsed.
An optional numeric argument can be passed in which will be used instead
of `Kernel.tick_count`.

Here is an example of how elapsed_time can be used.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.last_click_at ||= 0

    # record when a mouse click occurs
    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      args.state.last_click_at = Kernel.tick_count
    end

    # Use Numeric#elapsed_time to determine how long it's been
    if args.state.last_click_at.elapsed_time > 120
      args.outputs.labels << [10, 710, "It has been over 2 seconds since the mouse was clicked."]
    end
  end
#+end_src

And here is an example where the override parameter is passed in:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.last_click_at ||= 0

    # create a state variable that tracks time at half the speed of Kernel.tick_count
    args.state.simulation_tick = Kernel.tick_count.idiv 2

    # record when a mouse click occurs
    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      args.state.last_click_at = args.state.simulation_tick
    end

    # Use Numeric#elapsed_time to determine how long it's been
    if (args.state.last_click_at.elapsed_time args.state.simulation_tick) > 120
      args.outputs.labels << [10, 710, "It has been over 4 seconds since the mouse was clicked."]
    end
  end
#+end_src


** ~elapsed?~
Returns true if ~Numeric#elapsed_time~ is greater than the number. An optional parameter can be
passed into ~elapsed?~ which is added to the number before evaluating whether ~elapsed?~ is true.

Example usage (no optional parameter):

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.box_queue ||= []

    if args.state.box_queue.empty?
      args.state.box_queue << { name: :red,
                                destroy_at: Kernel.tick_count + 60 }
      args.state.box_queue << { name: :green,
                                destroy_at: Kernel.tick_count + 60 }
      args.state.box_queue << { name: :blue,
                                destroy_at: Kernel.tick_count + 120 }
    end

    boxes_to_destroy = args.state
                           .box_queue
                           .find_all { |b| b[:destroy_at].elapsed? }

    if !boxes_to_destroy.empty?
      puts "boxes to destroy count: #{boxes_to_destroy.length}"
    end

    boxes_to_destroy.each { |b| puts "box #{b} was elapsed? on #{Kernel.tick_count}." }

    args.state.box_queue -= boxes_to_destroy
  end
#+end_src

Example usage (with optional parameter):

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.box_queue ||= []

    if args.state.box_queue.empty?
      args.state.box_queue << { name: :red,
                                create_at: Kernel.tick_count + 120,
                                lifespan: 60 }
      args.state.box_queue << { name: :green,
                                create_at: Kernel.tick_count + 120,
                                lifespan: 60 }
      args.state.box_queue << { name: :blue,
                                create_at: Kernel.tick_count + 120,
                                lifespan: 120 }
    end

    # lifespan is passed in as a parameter to ~elapsed?~
    boxes_to_destroy = args.state
                           .box_queue
                           .find_all { |b| b[:create_at].elapsed? b[:lifespan] }

    if !boxes_to_destroy.empty?
      puts "boxes to destroy count: #{boxes_to_destroy.length}"
    end

    boxes_to_destroy.each { |b| puts "box #{b} was elapsed? on #{Kernel.tick_count}." }

    args.state.box_queue -= boxes_to_destroy
  end
#+end_src


** ~to_sf~
Returns a "string float" representation of a number with two decimal places. eg: ~5.8778~ will be shown as ~5.88~.

** ~to_si~
Returns a "string int" representation of a number with underscores for thousands seperator. eg: ~50000.8778~ will be shown as ~50_000~.

** ~new?~
Returns true if ~Numeric#elapsed_time == 0~. Essentially communicating that
number is equal to the current frame.

Example usage:

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.box_queue ||= []

    if args.state.box_queue.empty?
      args.state.box_queue << { name: :red,
                                create_at: Kernel.tick_count + 60 }
    end

    boxes_to_spawn_this_frame = args.state
                                    .box_queue
                                    .find_all { |b| b[:create_at].new? }

    boxes_to_spawn_this_frame.each { |b| puts "box #{b} was new? on #{Kernel.tick_count}." }

    args.state.box_queue -= boxes_to_spawn_this_frame
  end
#+end_src

* ~Kernel~

Kernel in the DragonRuby Runtime has patches for how standard out is handled and also
contains a unit of time in games called a tick.


** ~tick_count~

Returns the current tick of the game. This value is reset if you call $gtk.reset.


** ~global_tick_count~

Returns the current tick of the application from the point it was started. This value is never reset.
