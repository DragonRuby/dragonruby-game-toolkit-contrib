# Grid (`args.grid`)

Provides information about the screen and game canvas.

## `orientation`

Returns either `:landscape` (default) or `:portrait`. The orientation of your game is set within `./mygame/metadata/game_metadata.txt`.

## `origin_name`

Returns either `:bottom_left` (default) or `:center`.

## `origin_bottom_left!`

Change the grids coordinate system where `0, 0` is at the bottom left
corner. `origin_name` will be set to `:bottom_left`.

## `origin_center!`

Change the grids coordinate system where `0, 0` is at the center of the
screen. `origin_name` will be set to `:center`.

## Grid Property Categorizations

There are two categories of Grid properties that you should be aware of:

- Logical: Values are represented at the logical scale of `720p`
  (1280x720 for landscape orientation or 720x1280 portrait mode).
- Pixels: Values are represented in the context of Pixels for a given display.

!> You will almost always use the Logical Category's properties.
<br/>
<br/>
The Pixel is helpful for sanity checking of Texture Atlases, creating
C Extensions, and Shaders (Indie and Pro License features).  
<br/>
<br/>
For the Standard License, the Pixel Category
properties will all return values from the Logical Category.

Here's an example of what the property conventions look like:

```ruby
def tick args
  # Logical width
  args.grid.w

  # Width in pixels
  args.grid.w_px
end
```

Note: `Grid` properties are globally accessible via `$grid`.

!> All Grid properties that follow take `origin_name`, and `orientation` into consideration.

## `bottom`

Returns value that represents the bottom of the grid. 

Given that the logical canvas is `720p`, these are the values that
`bottom` may return:

- origin: `:bottom_left`, orientation: `:landscape`: `0`
- origin: `:bottom_left`, orientation: `:portrait`: `0`
- origin: `:center`, orientation: `:landscape`: `-360`
- origin: `:center`, orientation: `:portrait`: `-640`

## `top`

Returns value that represents the top of the grid.

## `left`

Returns value that represents the left of the grid.

## `right`

Returns the `x` value that represents the right of the grid.

## `rect`

Returns a rectangle Primitive that represents the grid.

## `w`

Returns the grid's width.

## `h`

Returns the grid's width.

## HD, HighDPI, and All Screen Modes

The following properties are available to Pro License holders. These
features are enabled via `./mygame/metadata/game_metadata.txt`:

- `hd=true`: Enable Texture Atlases and HD label/font rendering. Grid
  properties in the Pixel Category will reflect true values instead of values
  from the Logical Category.
- `highdpi=true`: HD must be enabled before this property will be
   respected. Texture Atlas selection and label/font rendering
   takes into consideration the hardware's resolution/rendering
   capabilities.
- `hd_letterbox=false`: Removes the game's 16:9 letterbox, allowing
  you to render edge to edge (All Screen). Game content will be
  centered within the 16:9 safe area.

!> For a demonstration of these configurations/property usages, see: `./samples/07_advanced_rendering/03_allscreen_properties`.

When All Screen mode is enabled (`hd_letterbox=false`), you can render
outside of the 1280x720 safe area. The 1280x720 logical canvas will be
centered within the screen and scaled to one of the following
closest/best-fit resolutions.

-   720p: 1280x720
-   HD+: 1600x900
-   1080p: 1920x1080
-   1440p: 2560x1440
-   1880p: 3200x1800
-   4k: 3840x2160
-   5k: 6400x2880

### All Screen Properties

These properties provide dimensions of the screen outside of the 16:9
safe area as logical `720p` values.

- `allscreen_left`
- `allscreen_right`
- `allscreen_top`
- `allscreen_bottom`
- `allscreen_w`
- `allscreen_h`
- `allscreen_offset_x`
- `allscreen_offset_y`

!> With the main canvas being centered in the screen, `allscreen_left`
and `allscreen_bottom` may return negative numbers for origin
`:bottom_left` since `x: 0, y: 0` might not align with the bottom left border of the game window.

!> It is strongly recommended that you don't use All Screen properties
for any elements the player would interact with (eg buttons in an
options menu) as they could get rendered underneath a "notch" on a
mobile device or at the far edge of an ultrawide display.

#### Logical, Point, Pixel Category Value Comparisons

!> Reminder: it's unlikely that you'll use any of the
`_px` variants. The explanation that follows if for those
that want the nitty gritty details.

Here are the values that a 16-inch MacBook Pro would return for
`allscreen_` properties.

### Texture Atlases

### `texture_scale`

Returns a decimal value representing the rendering scale of the game.

-   720p: 1.0
-   HD+: 1.25
-   1080p, Full HD: 1.5
-   Full HD+: 1.75
-   1440p: 2.0
-   1880p: 2.5
-   4k: 3.0
-   5k: 4.0

### `texture_scale_enum`

Returns an integer value representing the rendering scale of the game
at a best-fit value. For example, given a render scale of 2.7, the
textures atlas that will be selected will be 1880p (enum_value `250`).

-   720p: 100
-   HD+: 125
-   1080p, Full HD: 150
-   Full HD+: 175
-   1440p: 200
-   1880p: 250
-   4k: 300
-   5k: 400

Given the following code:

```ruby
def tick args
  args.outputs.sprites << { x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100, path: "sprites/player.png" }
end
```

The sprite path of `sprites/player.png` will be replaced according to
the following naming conventions (fallback to a lower resolution is
automatically handled if a sprite with naming convention isn't found):

-   720p: `sprites/player.png` (100x100)
-   HD+: `sprites/player@125.png` (125x125)
-   1080p: `sprites/player@150.png` (150x150)
-   1440p: `sprites/player@200.png` (200x200)
-   1880p: `sprites/player@250.png` (250x250)
-   4k: `sprites/player@300.png` (300x300)
-   5k: `sprites/player@400.png` (400x400)
