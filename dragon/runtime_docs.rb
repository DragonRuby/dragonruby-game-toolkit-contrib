* SUMMARY: ~def tick args; end;~
Most everything you will need to build your game is in the ~args~ parameter that is provided to your ~tick~ method. Follows is a high level summary of each function that is available from ~args~.

All the properties below hang off of ~args~ and can be accessed in the ~tick~ method:
#+begin_src
  def tick args
    args.PROPERTY
  end
#+end_src
** ~args.state~
Store your game state inside of this ~state~. Properties with arbitrary nesting is allowed and a backing Entity will be created on your behalf.
#+begin_src
  def tick args
    args.state.player.x ||= 0
    args.state.player.y ||= 0
  end
#+end_src
*** ~args.state.*.entity_id~
Entities automatically receive an ~entity_id~ of type ~Fixnum~.
*** ~args.state.*.entity_type~
Entities can have an ~entity_type~ which is represented as a ~Symbol~.
*** ~args.state.*.created_at~
Entities have ~created_at~ set to ~args.state.tick_count~ when they are created.
*** ~args.state.*.created_at_elapsed~
Returns the elapsed number of ticks since creation.
*** ~args.state.*.global_created_at~
Entities have ~global_created_at~ set to ~Kernel.global_tick_count~ when they are created.
*** ~args.state.*.global_created_at_elapsed~
Returns the elapsed number of global ticks since creation.
*** ~args.state.*.as_hash~
Entity cast to a ~Hash~ so you can update values as if you were updating a ~Hash~.

** ~args.outputs~

Outputs is how you render primitives to the screen. The minimal setup for
rendering something to the screen is via a ~tick~ method defined in
mygame/app/main.rb

#+begin_src
  def tick args
    args.outputs.solids     << [0, 0, 100, 100]
    args.outputs.sprites    << [100, 100, 100, 100, "sprites/square/blue.png"]
    args.outputs.labels     << [200, 200, "Hello World"]
    args.outputs.lines      << [300, 300, 400, 400]
  end
#+end_src

Primitives are rendered first-in, first-out. The rendering order (sorted by bottom-most to top-most):

- ~triangles~
- ~solids~
- ~sprites~
- ~primitives~: Accepts all render primitives. Useful when you want to bypass the default rendering orders for rendering (eg. rendering solids on top of sprites).
- ~labels~
- ~lines~
- ~borders~
- ~debug~: Accepts all render primitives. Use this to render primitives for debugging (production builds of your game will not render this layer).

*** ~args.outputs.background_color~
Set ~args.outputs.background_color~ to an ~Array~ with ~RGB~ values (eg. ~[255, 255, 255]~ for the color white).
*** ~args.outputs.sounds~
Send a file path to this collection to play a sound. The sound file must be under the ~mygame~ directory. Example: ~args.outputs.sounds << "sounds/jump.wav"~.
*** ~args.outputs.solids~
Send a Primitive to this collection to render a filled in rectangle to the screen. This collection is cleared at the end of every frame.
*** ~args.outputs.static_solids~
Send a Primitive to this collection to render a filled in rectangle to the screen. This collection is not cleared at the end of every frame. And objects can be mutated by reference.
*** ~args.outputs.sprites~, ~.static_sprites~
Send a Primitive to this collection to render a sprite to the screen.
*** ~args.outputs.primitives~, ~.static_primitives~
Send a Primitive of any type and it'll be rendered. The Primitive must have a ~primitive_marker~ that returns ~:solid~, ~:sprite~, ~:label~, ~:line~, ~:border~.
*** ~args.outputs.labels~, ~.static_labels~
Send a Primitive to this collection to render text to the screen.
*** ~args.outputs.lines~, ~.static_lines~
Send a Primitive to this collection to render a line to the screen.
*** ~args.outputs.borders~, ~.static_borders~
Send a Primitive to this collection to render an unfilled rectangle to the screen.
*** ~args.outputs.debug~, ~.static_debug~
Send any Primitive to this collection which represents things you render to the screen for debugging purposes. Primitives in this collection will not be rendered in a production release of your game.
** ~args.geometry~
This property contains geometric functions. Functions can be invoked via ~args.geometry.FUNCTION~.

Here are some general notes with regards to the arguments these geometric functions accept.

1. ~Rectangles~ can be represented as an ~Array~ with four (or more) values ~[x, y, w, h]~, as a ~Hash~ ~{ x:, y:, w:, h: }~ or an object that responds to ~x~, ~y~, ~w~, and ~h~.
2. ~Points~ can be represent as an ~Array~ with two (or more) values ~[x, y]~, as a ~Hash~ ~{ x:, y:}~ or an object that responds to ~x~, and ~y~.
3. ~Lines~ can be represented as an ~Array~ with four (or more) values ~[x, y, x2, y2]~, as a ~Hash~ ~{ x:, y:, x2:, y2: }~ or an object that responds to ~x~, ~y~, ~x2~, and ~y2~.

The built in easing definitions you have access to are ~:identity~, ~:flip~, ~:quad~, ~:cube~, ~:quart~, and ~:quint~.

This example will move a box at a linear speed from 0 to 1280.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    start_time = 10

                                        duration,
                                        :identity
    args.outputs.solids << { x: 1280 * current_progress, y: 360, w: 10, h: 10 }
  end
#+end_src
*** ~args.easing.ease_spline start_tick, current_tick, duration, spline~
Given a start, current, duration, and a multiple bezier values, this function returns a number between 0 and 1 that represents the progress of an easing function.

This example will move a box at a linear speed from 0 to 1280 and then back to 0 using two bezier definitions (represented as an array with four values).

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    start_time = 10
    duration = 60
    spline = [
      [  0, 0.25, 0.75, 1.0],

Labels (~args.outputs.labels~) ignore newline characters ~\\n~.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    long_string = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\nInteger dolor velit, ultricies vitae libero vel, aliquam imperdiet enim."
    max_character_length = 30
    long_strings_split = args.string.wrapped_lines long_string, max_character_length
    args.outputs.labels << long_strings_split.map_with_index do |s, i|
      { x: 10, y: 600 - (i * 20), text: s }

  def docs_calcstringbox
    <<-S
* DOCS: ~GTK::Runtime#calcstringbox~
This function returns the width and height of a string.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.string_size           ||= args.gtk.calcstringbox "Hello World"
    args.state.string_size_font_size ||= args.gtk.calcstringbox "Hello World"
  end

  def docs_write_file
    <<-S
* DOCS: ~GTK::Runtime#write_file~
This function takes in two parameters. The first parameter is the file path and assumes the the game
directory is the root. The second parameter is the string that will be written. The method overwrites whatever
is currently in the file. Use ~GTK::Runtime#append_file~ to append to the file as opposed to overwriting.

#+begin_src ruby
  def tick args
    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      args.gtk.write_file "last-mouse-click.txt", "Mouse was clicked at \#{args.state.tick_count}."
    end
  end

  end

      def docs_benchmark
<<-S
* DOCS: ~GTK::Runtime#benchmark~
You can use this function to compare the relative performance of methods.

#+begin_src ruby

    if args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.r
      args.gtk.console.show
      args.gtk.benchmark iterations: 1000, # number of iterations
