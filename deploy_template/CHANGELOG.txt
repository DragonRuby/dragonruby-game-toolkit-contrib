= 1.14 =

 * [Support] Better HTML5 template. Additional JS events added to
   handle loss of keyboard input within an iframe.
 * [Bugfix] `args.outputs.screenshots` regression fixed.
 * [Docs] Added documentation for a few more Numeric methods.
 * [Samples] Brand new advanced sample app: 99_sample_sprite_animation_creator.
   The sample app uses `args.outputs.screenshots` and `render_targets` heavily along with
   in memory queues as a means to consolidate events coming from
   different parts of the app.


= 1.13 =

 * [API] Sprite angle now accepts fractional degrees.
 * [Samples] Better font added to LOWREZJAM 2020 template.
 * [API] Added `args.outputs[RENDER_TARGET_NAME]` as an alias to
   `args.render_target(RENDER_TARGET_NAME)`. Either of the following will work:

   ```ruby
   def tick args
     if args.state.tick_count == 1
        args.render_target(:camera).width  = 100
        args.render_target(:camera).height = 100
        args.render_target(:camera).solids << [0, 0, 50, 50, 255, 0, 0]
     end

     if args.state.tick_count > 0
       args.outputs.sprites << { x: 0,
                                 y: 0,
                                 w: 500,
                                 h: 500,
                                 source_x: 0,
                                 source_y: 0,
                                 source_w: 50,
                                 source_h: 50,
                                 path: :camera }
     end
   end

   $gtk.reset
   ```

   Is the same as:

   ```ruby
   def tick args
     if args.state.tick_count == 1
        args.outputs[:camera].width  = 100
        args.outputs[:camera].height = 100
        args.outputs[:camera].solids << [0, 0, 50, 50, 255, 0, 0]
     end

     if args.state.tick_count > 0
       args.outputs.sprites << { x: 0,
                                 y: 0,
                                 w: 500,
                                 h: 500,
                                 source_x: 0,
                                 source_y: 0,
                                 source_w: 50,
                                 source_h: 50,
                                 path: :camera }
     end
   end

   $gtk.reset
   ```

= 1.12 =

 * [Samples] LOWREZ Jam sample app reworked in preparation for LOWREZ
   Jam 2020 (starts on August 1st so hurry and join).
 * [Docs] Docs added for GTK::Mouse, you can access them via the
   Console by typing `GTK::Mouse.docs` or `$gtk.args.inputs.mouse.docs`.
 * [MacOS] Updated minimum OS support to include MacOS 10.9+.

= 1.11 =

 * [Bugfix] Fixed error in docs_search "TERM".

= 1.10 =

 * [Support] Documentation infrastructure added (take a look at docs/docs.html). Bring up the DragonRuby Console and:

   To search docs you can type `docs_search "SEARCH TERM"`

   If you want to get fancy you can provide a `lambda` to filter documentation:

   docs_search { |entry| (entry.include? "Array") && (!entry.include? "Enumerable") }

 * [Bugfix] Fixed sprite rendering issues with source_(x|y|w|h) properties on sprites.
 * [Support] Removed double buffering of game if framerate drops below 60 fps.
 * [Support] Console now supports mouse wheel scrolling.
 * [Support] One time notifications have less noise/easier to read.
 * [Bugfix] Rogue ~app/main.rb~ directory will no longer be created if you run a sample app.

= 1.9 =

 * [Bugfix] HTTP on windows should now work, for real this time.
 * [Bugfix] Non-720p render targets now use correct coordinate system.

= 1.8 =

 * [Experimental] Added the ability to control the logical game size. You can use cli
   arguments to set it. Example ultra-wide support would be:
   `./dragonruby --window_width 3840 --window_height 1080`
 * [Bugfix] HTTP on windows should now work.
 * [Bugfix] `even?` and `odd?` return the correct result for Fixnum.
 * [Bugfix] args.intputs.mouse_wheel now reports the delta change in x and y correctly.
 * [Bugfix] Improved analog joystick accuracy when converting to percentages.
 * [Support] Incorporated pull request from https://github.com/kfischer-okarin that adds
   autocompletion to the Console. This is the PR:
   - https://github.com/DragonRuby/dragonruby-game-toolkit-contrib/commit/da0fdcfbd2bd9739fe056eb646920df79a32954c
   - https://github.com/DragonRuby/dragonruby-game-toolkit-contrib/commit/99305ca79118fa0704c8681f4019738b8c7a500d

= 1.7 =

 * [BREAKING] args.inputs.mouse.wheel.point is gone. Use args.inputs.mouse.x
   and .y if you need cursor position.
 * [BREAKING] args.inputs.mouse.wheel.x and .y now represent the amount the
   mousewheel/trackpad has moved since the last tick and not the mouse cursor
   position. Use args.inputs.mouse.x and .y if you need cursor position.

= 1.6 =

 * [API] Sprite now supports source_(x|y|w|h). These properties are consistent with the origin
   being in the bottom left. The existing properties tile_(x|y|w|h) assumes that origin 0, 0 is in the top left.
   The code below will render the same sprite (in their respective coordinate systems):

   # using tile_(x|y|w|h) properties
   args.outputs.sprites << { x: 0,
                             y: 0,
                             w: 1280,
                             h: 100,
                             path: :block,
                             tile_x: 0,
                             tile_y: 720 - 100,
                             tile_w: 1280,
                             tile_h: 100 }

   is equivalent to:

   # using source_(x|y|w|h) properties
   args.outputs.sprites << { x: 0,
                             y: 0,
                             w: 1280,
                             h: 100,
                             path: :block,
                             source_x: 0,
                             source_y: 0,
                             source_w: 1280,
                             source_h: 100 }

   Note: if you provide both tile_(x|y|w|h) and source_(x|y|w|h). The values of tile_ will "win" so as not to
   break existing code out there.
 * [Bugfix] Updated require to remove duplicate requires of the same file (or files that have recently been required).
 * [Bugfix] Strict entities of different types/names serialize and deserialize correctly.
 * [Samples] Updated render targets sample app to show two render targets with transparencies.
 * [API] No really, render targets now have a transparent background and respect opacity.

= 1.5 =

 * [API] Added $gtk.show_cursor and $gtk.hide_cursor to show and hide the mouse cursor. The
   function only needs to be called once. EG: args.gtk.hide_cursor if args.state.tick_count == 0.
 * [Samples] Jam Craft 2020 sample app updated to have more comments and demonstrate a custom
   mouse cursor.

= 1.4 =

 * [Bugfix] Adding $gtk.reset at the bottom of main.rb will no longer cause an infinite loop.
 * [Samples] Sample app added for Jam Craft 2020.

= 1.3 =

 * [Bugfix] Adding $gtk.reset at the bottom of main.rb will no longer cause an infinite loop.
 * [Samples] Better instructions added to various sample apps.

= 1.2 =

 * [Bugfix] Top-level require statements within main.rb will load before
   invoking the rest of the code in main.rb.
 * [Samples] Better keyboard input sample app.
 * [Samples] New sample app that shows how to use Numeric#ease_spline.
 * [Bugfix] Fixed "FFI::Draw cannot be serialized" error message.

= 1.1 =

 * [Bugfix] Fixed exception associated with providing serialization related help.
 * [Bugfix] Fixed comments on how to run tests from CLI.
 * [Support] More helpful global variables added. Here's a list:
   - $gtk
   - $console
   - $args
   - $state
   - $tests
   - $record
   - $replay
 * [API] inputs.keyboard.key_(down|held|up).any? and inputs.keyboard.key_(down|held|up).all?
   added.
 * [Support] Recording gameplay and replaying streamlined a bit more. GIVE THE
   REPLAY FEATURE A SHOT! IT'S AWESOME!! Bring up the console and run: $record.start SEED_NUMBER.
 * [Support] Bringing up the console will stop a replay if one is running.

= 1.0 =

 * [News] DragonRuby Game Toolkit turns 1.0. Happy birthday!
 * [Bugfix] args.state.new_entity_strict serializes and deserializes correctly now.
 * [BREAKING] Entity#hash has been renamed to Entity#as_hash so as not to redefine
   Object#hash. This is a "private" method so you probably don't have to worry about
   anything breaking on your end.
 * [BREAKING] gtk.save_state and gtk.load_state have been replaced with gtk.serialize_state
   and gtk.deserialize_state (helpful error messages have been added).
 * [Support] Console can now render sprites (this is still in its early stages). Try
   $gtk.console.addsprite(w: 50, h: 50, path: "some_path.png").
 * [API] Render targets now have a transparent background and respect opacity.
 * [API] Render targets can be cached/programatically created once and reused.
 * [Samples] A new render target sample app has been created to show how to cache them.
 * [Samples] Easing sample app reworked/simplified.
 * [Support] GTK will keep a backup of your source file changes under the tmp directory.
   One day this feature will save your ass.

= 20200301 =

 * [Samples] Added sample app that shows how you can draw a cubic bezier curves.
 * [Support] Keyup event prints key and raw_key to the console.
 * [Support] Circumflex now opens the console.

= 20200227 =

 * [Bugfix] Game will now auto restart in the event of a syntax error.
 * [Samples] Sample app added to show how to use a sprite sheet for sprite animations:
   09_sprite_animation_using_tile_sheet.
 * [Samples] Sample app added to show how to use a tile sheet for a roguelike:
   20_roguelike_starting_point_two.
 * [Samples] Example code added to show how sort an array with a custom sort block:
   00_intermediate_ruby_primer/07_powerful_arrays.txt
 * [OSS] The following files have been open sourced at https://github.com/DragonRuby/dragonruby-game-toolkit-contrib:
   - modified: dragon/args.rb
   - new file: dragon/assert.rb

   - new file: dragon/tests.rb
   - new file: dragon/trace.rb
 * [Support] Added isometric placeholder sprites.
 * [Support] Added $gtk.reset_sprite 'path' to refresh a sprite from
   the file system (while the game is running). Future releases will
   automatically auto load sprites but you can use this to reload them
   on demand.

= 20200225 =

 * [Bugfix] Fixed macOS compatibility back to Mac OS X 10.9 or so.

= 20200224 =

  * [Bugfix] Some of the deprecation notices where throwing an exception. This has been fixed.
  * [API] $gtk.system(cmd) has been added. You'll find this helpful for running cli programs from
    Heads Up Display. It's probably not a good idea to use this in a production game (since you'll
    be responsible for making sure it works on all platforms).

= 20200218 =

  * [API] Enhanced screenshotting api that can be used for image manipulation.
    Take a look at the painting sample app.
    Example usage: `args.outputs.screenshots << [0, 0, 100, 100, 'bottom-left-corner.png']`.
  * [BREAKING] Outputs#static_background_color has been renamed to Outputs#background_color.
  * [API] Outputs#debug and Outputs#static_debug layer has been added. You can use this layer
    to draw all your guide lines and helper primitives. When the game is published, this layer
    will not render.

= 20200217 =

  * [Bugfix] `dragonruby-publish` would only build html5. It now builds
    all of the platforms again. Ryan has given Amir a warning and has told him
    to be more careful releasing. Amir cackled in defiance.

= 20200213 =

  * [API] Added Float#pos? and Float#neg?.
  * [Samples] Sample added to show how to use directional_vector and sprite sheets.
  * [Samples] Updated 01_api_01_labels sample app to show how to render a label
    as an array or hash.
  * [Bugfix] Fixed incorrectly named value for labels in 11_hash_primitives sample app.

= 20200211 =

  * [API] Added `args.inputs.directional_vector` and
    `args.inputs.(keyboard|controller_one|controller_two).directional_vector.
    The sample app to demonstrate the use of this feature is pending.
  * [API] Added Numeric#pos? and Numeric#neg?.
  * [Bugfix] Fixed looping issues with ogg files and popping issues with
    playing sounds in general.
  * [Bugfix] `args.gtk.console.toast :message, "some message"` would fail because
    of an invalid method name.
  * [News] Amir (the CEO of DragonRuby LLP) wrote a 2019 year end review. You can
    read it here: http://www.rubymotion.com/news/2020/01/02/year-end-review.html.
  * [News] Expect the frequency of updates of GTK to increase. Ryan let Amir have
    the deployment passwords, so the rate limiter is now gone :3

= 20200202 =

  * [API] Hash now supports :scale_rect.
  * [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to create a hexagon based grid.
  * [Support] Initial work on CHEATSHEET.txt.
  * [API] Added args.inputs.keyboard.ctrl_* which will return true if Ctrl is
    combined with another key.
  * [API] Added args.inputs.click (which only returns the point or nil).
  * [API] Added Numeric#even? and Numeric#odd?.
  * [API] Added Geometry#point_inside_circle?(point, circle_point, radius).

= 2020130 =

  * [Performance] Rendering api optimizations. Initial tests show that
    DragonRuby Game Toolkit can now render more sprites (and calculate
    more collisions) than Unity 2D. Checkmate.
  * [Support] Fixed documentation for labels (the hash properties are
    called size_enum, and alignment_enum). The documentation can be
    found under mygame/documentation.
  * [Support] Improved help text for exceptions related to ambiguous use
    of primitives.
  * [Bugfix] Requiring multiple ruby files will no long "blip" an
    exception on startup.

= 20191201 =

  * [Samples] Added sample game called The Little Probe that demonstrates
    line collision.
  * [Samples] Experiments with squares and cubes in 3D.
  * [Support] HTML5 games now package a favicon.
  * [Samples] [Support] Quite a few of the sample apps have been updated to
    include an api listing at the top (expansion of documentation).
  * [API] Initial work for http has been created. Take a look at the
    http sample app to see how to use it. Take a look at
    `samples/99_zz_gtk_unit_tests` for a test suite that asserts async
    http.
  * [Support] [Samples] Added a sample app that shows how create
    collision detection associated with constraint points against
    a ramp. This sample app also demonstrates the use of `gtk.slowmo!`
    which you can use the slow down the tick execution of your game
    to see things frame by frame (still experimental).
  * [Support] Added sprites to default template folder. The sprites
    are `sprites/square-COLOR.png` and `sprites/circle-COLOR.png` where
    the colors are of the rainbow ROY G. BIV (eg `sprites/square-red.png`).
  * [Sample] Added a sample app that shows how to use the
    `static_sprites` rendering api which is the fastest way to render
    a sprite (but also hangs on the instances by reference as opposed
    to treating the collection as a queue... a trade off between
    immutablility and speed).
  * [API] Added the `attr_sprite` class macro which can be mixed into
    a class so that it quacks like a sprite. The Sprite Limits sample
    app has been updated to use this macro.
  * [Support] In the event of an exception, the class hierarchy for
    the object that threw the exception is provided.
  * [Support] In the event of a :method_missing exception, the
    instance's API is searched for methods that look like the one you
    were trying to call. Those recommendations are printed to the
    console.
  * [Samples] [Support] Significant enhancements have been made to the
    test harness. Take a look at `samples/99_zz_gtk_unit_tests` to see
    some of the test suites that are being fleshed out. These test
    suites are used as regression during builds. More will come.
  * [Samples] Unit tests added for geometry apis.
  * [Samples] Unit tests added for parsing json and xml.
  * [Bugfix] HTML5 builds no longer fail at startup with an audio
    initialization error message.
  * [Bugfix] The $gtk.write_file API change was a mistake. The actual
    bug it was meant to resolve has been fixed. The responsible
    parties have been brutally disciplined.
  * [BREAKING] `gtk_args` class macro has been renamed to
    `attr_gtk`. This is a little easier to remember because it follows
    the same pattern as `attr_accessor`.
  * [BREAKING] `PRIMITIVE.w(idth)_half` and `PRIMITIVE.h(eight)_half`
    have been deprecated. Use `PRIMITIVE.w.half` (Numeric#half).
  * [BREAKING] `PRIMITIVE.angle_given_point` has been deprecated. Use
    `PRIMITIVE.angle_from`.
  * [API] `PRIMITIVE.angle_to` has been added. Take a look at
    `samples/99_zz_gtk_unit_tests` for usages.
  * [BREAKING] `intersects_rect?` with an `s` has been deprecated. Use
    `intersect_rect?` instead.
    NOTE: Ruby's naming convention is to generally *not* include the
    \"s\" for interrogative method names (methods that end with a ?
    [question mark]). It doesn't sound grammatically correct, but that
    has been the rule for a long time (and why intersects_rect? has
    been deprecated).
  * [Samples] Added a white label version of Clepto Frog, a Ludam Dare
    game built by Amir, Karen, and Rye. You can see the final version
    (with all assets) here: https://amirrajan.itch.io/clepto-frog. The
    code is horrible. Who wrote this crap?
  * [Bugfix] Fixed looping issues with `.ogg`. The follow statement
    will now correctly work:
    ```
    def tick args
      if args.state.tick_count == 0
         args.outputs.sounds << 'sounds/sample.ogg'
      end
    end
    ```
  * [API] Added `args.gtk.stop_music` to stop all looping music.
  * [API] Added `args.geometry` which contains stateless functions
    that exist on primitives. For a full listing of methods open up
    the console and type `args.geometry.help`. A lot of these methods
    are exercised in the `samples/99_zz_gtk_unit_tests` test suite.
  * [Support] The --no-tick switch for ./dragonruby will now hide the
    game window (it's a good way to run "headless" unit
    tests/regressions suites). Usage: `./dragonruby mygame --eval
    some_ruby_file.rb --no-tick`.
  * [BREAKING] gtk.on_ticks has been deprecated, use the better named
    gtk.scheduled_callbacks instead.
  * [BREAKING] gtk.on_tick TICKCOUNT { BLOCK } has been deprecated, use the better named
    gtk.schedule_callback TICKCOUNT { BLOCK } instead.

= release-20190930 =

  * [Samples] Added sample app that shows how trace can be used within a class.
  * [Support] Added $gtk.log_level. Valid values are :on,
    :off. When the value is set to :on, GTK log messages will show up
    in the DragonRuby Console *AND* be written to logs/log.txt. When the
    value is set to :off, GTK log messages will *NOT* show up in the
    console, but will *STILL* be written to logs/log.txt
  * [API] Added args.inputs.mouse.(click|up|down).(x|y) so you don't have to do
    args.inputs.mouse.click.point.
  * [Support] You can change your window title at runtime with
    $gtk.set_window_title('new title'). YOU MUST SET UP YOUR GAME'S METADATA
    CORRECTLY EVEN IF YOU USE THIS FUNCTION.
  * [Support] The macOS build is now compiled with Link-Time
    Optimization, as an experiment, which makes your games a little faster and
    your downloads a little smaller.
  * [Support] We've split the open source licenses out of README.txt
    to their own file, which is packaged with your games, to be a good citizen
    of the world. If you add other open source stuff, just copy
    open-source-licenses.txt into your game's folder and add your own stuff
    to it; that will package with your game instead of the original text file.
  * [Support] Added JSON parsing. Try $gtk.parse_json(myJsonString) or
    $gtk.parse_json_file(filename)
  * [Support] Added XML parsing. Try $gtk.parse_xml(myXmlString) or
    $gtk.parse_xml_file(filename)
  * [BREAKING] There is a new replay data format that is less crappy. But it breaks
    existing replay data. You'll need to re-record your replays (sorry T_T).
    To record a replay of gameplay, you can run ./dragonruby mygame --record.
    When you close the game, a file called last_replay.txt will be created.
    You can re-run a replay as a means to perform visual regression using
    ./dragonruby mygame --replay last_replay.txt
  * [Support] Added a --production command line option for running an
    unpublished game as if it were published.
  * [Support] We now offer bleeding edge builds on the "experimental"
    channel on itch.io. If you want those, go to where you downloaded this
    package, and look for the "experimental" download instead. These are
    expected to be less stable and pushed as we need to test things out or
    hotfix a bug that isn't ready to roll into an official release. If this is
    your jam, though, go for it.
  * [OSS] Thank you to StardragonEX, phaedryx, and pusewicz for contributing
    to GTK documentation located at github.com/DragonRuby/dragonruby-game-toolkit-contrib.
  * [Support] Enabling trace! on an object now outputs
    all trace data to a file as opposed to just standard out. This will
    make trace debugging significantly more useful to developers that
    don't have a high-buffer-history terminal running.
  * [Samples] Added platformer that deals with moving objects, jumping, and dealing with inertia.
  * [Samples] Added sample showing how to render an isometric grid
    (like Into The Breach).
  * [Samples] Sample added showing how to use trace! debugging when you
    are having trouble with why an exception is being thrown.
  * [Samples] Many of the sample apps have had their methods reorganized
    for consistency in reading. They also have comments added to them.
  * [Experimental] If the game has been running for over a minute, and cannot
    keep a stable 60 fps, the game's rendering will be skipped every other
    frame to save process cycles (tick method will still execute as fast
    as possible, but results from them method will only be rendered at 30 fps).

= release-20190912 =

  * [Bugfix] dragonruby-publish now correctly builds HTML5 packages when
    there's a "'" character in the game's name (etc).
  * [Bugfix] dragonruby-httpd now serves paths with spaces in them correctly.
  * [Bugfix] dragonruby-publish now ignores __MACOSX directories (trash that
    macOS tends to generate when you double-click a .zip file to unpack it
    from the Finder).

  * [Bugfix] HTML5 builds' "click-to-play" UI now scales the icon.
  * [Bugfix] args.gtk.writefile(path, content [, write_to_game_dir = true])
    now writes file to the game folder as opposed to the root directory.
    If you need to write to the root directory provide false as the third
    parameter to write file.
  * [Experimental] There is now a special file in mygame called mailbox.rb.
    When `args.gtk.suppress_mailbox = false`, mailbox.rb will be checked for
    changes at a high frequency (10 times a second). Because this an
    experimental feature, the default value of `args.gtk.suppress_mailbox` is
    TRUE. You can use this file as a means to communicate with GTK between process.
    There is a sample app that shows how to use the mailbox.rb file.
  * [Support] You can now have multiple mouse buttons!
    args.inputs.mouse.click and .up will still be set if there was a mouse
    button change for the current tick, but you should look at
    args.inputs.mouse.button_left (or _middle or _right or _x1 or _x2) as a
    bool to see if it's currently pressed down. More than one might be pressed,
    and more than one button might have changed in the one .click you'll get.
    The same is true for .up
  * [Support] You can now see the mouse wheel (or your trackpad
    pretending to be a mouse wheel when you stroke it appropriately)!
    All wheel input since the last tick is added together. You can check if
    args.inputs.mouse.wheel isn't nil to decide if the wheel has moved for
    this tick.
    ```ruby
    m = args.inputs.mouse
    if m.wheel
      puts("The wheel moved #{m.wheel.x} left/right and #{m.wheel.y} up/down")
    end
    ```

= release-20190829 =

  * [Community] Discord link: http://discord.dragonruby.org and Youtube link: http://youtube.dragonruby.org.
  * [Support] Plugging in an unrecognized controller will now make DragonRuby pop up a
    UI to let the user configure it. During this time your game will receive no
    tick calls and so will be effectively paused. It resumes once the user has configured the
    controller or abandoned it. This is a work in progress, but we already
    think it's pretty cool.
  * [Experimental] [Advanced] You can start up ./dragonruby by passing in --eval file_path. The file passed in will
    execute on startup. Additionally you can pass in --eval file_path --no-tick which will
    exit ./dragonruby immediately after loading all source, and running the file passed to eval.
  * [Experimental] [Advanced] `on_tick` callback has been added to $gtk. This can be used to run some form of automation.
    For example, you can run the Dueling Starships sample app with the following inside of repl.rb.
    ```ruby
    # Reset the game and sent the RNG seed to 100
    $gtk.reset 100

    # Remove any existing callbacks.
    $gtk.on_ticks.clear

    # One second into the game, hold down the right directional
    # on controller one.
    $gtk.on_tick 60 do
      $gtk.args.inputs.controller_one.key_held.right = true
    end

    # On frame 80, release the right directional, and
    # hold down R1.
    $gtk.on_tick 80 do
      $gtk.args.inputs.controller_one.key_held.right = false
      $gtk.args.inputs.controller_one.key_up.right = true
      $gtk.args.inputs.controller_one.key_held.r1 = true
    end
    ```
    There is a full blown automation script under samples/00_beginner_ruby_primer/automation.rb
    ./samples/00_beginner_ruby_primer $ ../../dragonruby . --eval app/automation.rb
  * [Support] Exceptions `game_state_*.txt files are now written to an exceptions directory
    instead of cluttering up the root.
  * [Support] Launching dragonruby with --fullscreen on the command line makes the game fullscreen.
  * [Support] Launching dragonruby-publish from any directory with no command line arguments
    and without a "mygame" folder in the current working directory will
    cause it to look for "mygame" in the same directory as dragonruby-publish
    itself. Which is to say: it'll work in the default configuration if you
    double-click it from the macOS Finder.
  * [Samples] New sample app called 02_collisions_02_moving_objects has been added.
  * [Support] Previous console messages are subdued if unhandled exception is resolved.
    This removes visual confusion if another exception is thrown (easier to determine what the current exception is).
  * [Support] Added api documentation about truthy_keys for keyboards and controllers.
  * [API] [Experimental] Hashes now quack like render primitives. For example some_hash[:x] is the same as
    some_hash.x and can be interchangeable with some_array.x (this is a work in progress
    so there may be some geometric/collision apis that aren't covered).
  * [Support] Usability of Console and it's interaction with repl.rb is SIGNIFICANTLY better.
    Take a look at the new repl.rb file under mygame/repl.rb to see an interactive
    crash course of Ruby that shows how to use variables, functions, conditionals,
    loops, and arrays. Special thanks to @raulrita (https://www.twitch.tv/raulrita)
    for live streaming and bringing light to these enhancements.
  * [Support] `puts` statements that begin with "====" are rendered as teal in the Console. This
    provides a visual separation that will help with print line debugging.
  * [OSS] The DragonRuby Game Toolkit Console has been open sourced under an MIT license. You can find it
    here: https://github.com/DragonRuby/dragonruby-game-toolkit-contrib

= release-20190823 =

  * [Support] The mygame directory now contains a documentation folder that provides high level
    APIs for the engine (it's a work in progress, but a good starting point).
  * [Samples] A sample app called "hash primitives" has been added that shows how you can use a Hash
    to render a primitive. This will make specifying sprite's advanced properties much easier.
  * [Samples] The sprite limits sample app shows how you can ducktype a class and render it as a sprite.
    Doing this is a tiny bit more work, but there is a huge performance benefit.
  * [Bugfix] Internal limits total textures/render targets/fonts is removed.
  * [BREAKING] args.dragon has been deprecated, you must now use the new property args.gtk.
  * [BREAKING] args.game has been deprecated, you must now use the new property args.state.
  * [BREAKING] args.gtk.root has been removed and all attributes have been moved to args.gtk.
  * [BREAKING] args.gtk(.root).mouse_focus has been removed, use args.inputs.mouse.has_focus.
  * [BREAKING] args.gtk(.root).keyboard_focus has been removed, use args.inputs.keyboard.has_focus.
  * [BREAKING] $dragon has been removed, you must now use $gtk.
  * [BREAKING] $view has been removed and functionality has been moved to $gtk, use that variable instead.

= release-20190816 =

  * [Bugfix] HTML5: Fixed crash on startup on Chrome if the game's icon isn't tiny.
  * [Samples] Added sample app that shows how you can make a paint app (05_mouse_move_paint_app).
  * [Samples] Added sample app that shows how you can make a tile editor (05_mouse_move_tile_editor).
  * [Samples] Added LOWREZ Jam 2019 game that Amir built: Return of Serenity (99_sample_game_return_of_serenity).
  * [Samples] Added Metroidvania sample app which is a great starting point for the "Metroidvania Month" Jam on Itch.io.
  * [Support] :ordinal_indicator (º) character added to args.inputs.keyboard. It can be used to bring up the GTK console.

= release-20190813 =

  * [Samples] Added sample app that shows off controller input.
  * [API] `args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.delete is now available and works in the GTK console.
  * [Bugfix] Requiring a ruby file that doesn't exist will return an error instead of crashing.
  * [Support] Console coloring added for exceptions.
  * [Support] When running trace!, if an exception occurs. The last method invoked will
    be provided in the details.

= release-20190806 =

  * [Bugfix] Having $gtk.reset at the bottom of your main.rb will not cause a recursive require
    of all files.
  * [Support] In the event of an exception, the source code will not be searched if the
    search term is less than three characters.
  * [Samples] A Roguelike starting point sample app has been added.
  * [Support] If a primitive rendering fails, the primitive type will now be included
    with the exception.
  * [API] The property `args.outputs.static_background_color = [0, 0, 0]` is now exposed. This allows
    you to control the color of the letterbox around your game. Some of the sample apps have been
    updated to use this property (for example Dueling Starships).

= release-20190803 =

  * [Bugfix] `gtk_attr` now included the `inputs` attr_accessor.
  * [Website] The initial version of http://fiddle.dragonruby.org has
    been created. Try it out.
  * [Support] Eight new beginner sample apps have been added
    which breakdown the tech demo into consumable pieces (with comments).
  * [Support] The two introductory Ruby primers now contain links
    to video tutorials that you can use to follow along.
  * [Support] A game/sample app called Snakemoji has been added. Game
    development should be fun and about experimentation. This sample app
    was certainly built in the spirit of this. A big thank you to
    Anton K. (ai Doge) for this contribution.
  * [Support] Added $gtk.trace!(an_object) which will detailed print execution
    information. This should make it much easier to track down exceptions.
  * [Support] All source files are auto reloaded on save or when
    $gtk.reset is executed.
  * [Support] § (:section_sign) can now be used to open up the
    DragonRuby GTK Console.

= release-20190731 =

  * [Bugfix] Fixed bug in DragonRuby console returning evaled value.
  * [Support] Updated collisions sample app with comments.
  * [Support] Added comments for sprite animation sample app.
  * [Support] dragonruby-publish will look for your game in the
    "mygame" directory if not otherwise specified on the command line.
  * [Support] dragonruby-publish now puts packaged builds in
    "builds" directory instead of ".dragonruby/builds" so you can actually
    find them.

= release-20190712 =

  * [Bugfix] dragonruby-publish ignores .git/.hg/.svn directories.

= release-20190711 =

  * [Bugfix] Bug fix for Easing module rename. Sorry about that!
  * [Typo] Fixed grammar in sprite limits explanation.

= release-20190709 =

  * [Bugfix] Text scaling now works on Windows. Resize the window and your
    fonts should stay crisp now!
  * [Bugfix] dragonruby-httpd on Windows now has proper EXE metadata.
  * [API] Commonly used properties on `args` are now accessible as top
    level methods:

    ```
    def tick args
      args.(solids|sprites|lines|labels|borders|
           click|click_at|mouse|controller_one|controller_two|
           keyboard)
    end
    ```
  * [BREAKING] `args.game` has been deprecated is favor of the better
    named property `args.state`.
  * [Support] DragonRuby GTK Console now accepts input
    immediately (specifically while it's animating).
  * [API] Class macro `gtk_args` has been added. Instead of having to
    do:

    ```
    class Game
      attr_accessor :args, :grid, :state, :inputs, :outputs, :gtk, :passes,
                    :current_scene, :other_custom_attrs

      def tick
      end
    end

    def tick args
      $game.args    = args
      $game.grid    = args.grid
      $game.state   = args.state
      $game.outputs = args.outputs
      $game.gtk     = args.gtk
      $game.passes  = args.passes
      $game.tick
    end
    ```

    You can now do:

    ```
    class Game
      gtk_args
      attr_accessor :current_scene, :other_custom_attrs

      def tick
      end
    end

    def tick args
      $game.args = args
      $game.tick
    end
    ```
  * [API] [BREAKING] The globally accessible GTK Runtime has been renamed `$dragon` to
    `$gtk` (you can still use $dragon for now, but it is strongly
    recommended that you update your usages to $gtk).
  * [API] A new entity type has been introduced and is accessible via `args.state.new_entity_strict`
    the usage of StrictEntity over OpenEntity (`args.state.new_entity`) yield significantly faster
    property access. The downside is that `args.state.new_entity_strict` requires
    you to define all properties upfront within the implicit block. You will receive
    an exception if you attempt to access a property that hasn't be
    pre-defined. For usage info and performance differences, take a look at the Sprite Limit
    sample app.
  * [Support] Exception messages have been significantly improved. Hashes and Type .to_s
    information is well formatted. "stack too deep" exceptions resolved.
  * [API] [BREAKING] `args.outputs.PRIMITIVES +=` is no longer supported. Use `args.outputs.PRIMITIVES <<`
    for all concatenation of primitives to the outputs collection (trying to pick between += and << was confusing,
    we settled on <<).
  * [Support] Framerate warnings wait 10 seconds before calculating the moving average. If your
    framerates begin to drop, consider using `args.state.new_entity_static` for game structures that have been
    fleshed out.
  * [Performance] Rendering of primitives is can support over twice as many sprites at 60 fps (see Sprite Limits
    sample app for demonstration).
  * [Support] Headless testing has been added. Take a look at the Basic Gorillas sample app to see
    how headless testing can help you dial into frame-by-frame problems within your game.
  * [Samples] The "Controller Analog Usage Advanced Sprites" sample
    app now has a helper function with named parameters to create the
    sprite. For example, if you needed to flip a sprite vertically,
    you'd have to do the following:

    ```
    args.outputs.sprites << [0, 0, 100, 100,
                             'fighter.png',
                             0,
                             255, 255, 255, 255,
                             0, 0, -1, -1, false, true]
    ```

    With the helper method, you can write the following:

    ```
    args.outputs.sprites << create_sprite(x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100, vflip: true)
    ```

    We're still chewing on the API above before it gets integrated
    into GTK proper.
  * [API] "Superscript Two" can be used to bring up the DragonRuby
    Console. People with international keyboards (which don't have a ~
    key) can now use the `superscript_two` key (which is in the same
    place as the ~).
  * [API] All keyboard attributes now have a `!` variant which will
    clear the key if the value was true. Example:

    ```
    args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.up # returns true
    args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.up # still returns true
    ```

    VS

    ```
    args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.up! # returns true
    args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.up  # now returns false for the rest of this tick
    ```
  * [Samples] Added a sample app called "Sprite Animation and Keyboard
    Input" that shows how to do repeating and one-time sprite
    animations driven by keyboard input.
  * [Samples] All sample apps have the MIT License added to them (to
    remove any ambiguity with regards to if you can use them for
    commercial purposes).
  * [HTML5] Games published to HTML5 now has a loading progress bar.
  * [Samples] Added sample app called "Coordinate Systems" that show
    the two coordinate systems supported by the GTK.
  * [API] `args.inputs.mouse` now respects `args.dragon.origin_center!`.
  * [Samples] Added two sample apps called "Collision" and "Collision
    and Entities" that show how to perform collision detection with
    draw primitives and `args.state.new_entity`.
  * [Samples] Added an interactive sample app called "Beginner Ruby
    Primer" that does a better job of introducing you to the language.
  * [Samples] [Video] Amir facilitated a workshop at a local user
    group. The source code for the workshop is located in a sample app
    called "NDDNUG Workshop". The video was recorded and you can use
    that to code along: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3CFce1arC8).
  * [Bugfix] Windows and Mac icon generation in dragonruby-publish was
    broken in the previous build. Sorry! Fixed now.
  * [Bugfix] DragonRuby binaries are now codesigned on macOS. We are still
    working on signing games packaged by dragonruby-publish, but stay tuned!

= release-20190604 =

  * [BREAKING] `perc_to_zero` and `perc_to_one` have been deprecated
    and now throw and informative exception that will help you fix the
    problem. Moving forward, you'll need to use the new `lerp` APIs
    (details further down).
  * [BREAKING] `intersects_rect?` now takes in an optional parameter
    called `tolerance`. This parameter's default is set to `0.1`. The
    original tolerance value was set to `0`. So if you still want a
    tolerance of `0`, you'll need to update your `intersect_rect?`
    calls to: `intersects_rect?(other_rect, 0)`.
  * [IMPORTANT] [API] [Video] A Quake-style Heads Up Display (HUD),
    has been added. You can access this console by pressing the "~"
    key. This console can be used to experiment with Ruby, print debug
    logging, and diagnose errors. Here is Ryan showing the console in
    action: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHgV11F2ZPY)
  * [IMPORTANT] [API] [Video] Added the ability to create replays so you can
    do visual regression of your game. Here is this record/replay capability in
    action: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev0UMVBe-fY)
    ```
    args.dragon.start_recording(RNG_SEED)
    args.dragon.stop_recording(filename)
    args.dragon.start_replay(filename)
    args.dragon.stop_replay
    ```

    You can record your game on startup using the following command
    (it'll automatically save when you close the game):

    ```
    ./dragonruby(.exe) --record
    ```
  * [API] Rendering primitives now support `float` values for position
    and size.
  * [API] [Sample] [Video] Lerping/Easing APIs have been added. There is a
    sample app that shows all the things you can do with them. For
    philosophical motivations as to why the APIs look the way they do
    (and just simply a fantastic presentation), watch this
    presentation given by Squirrel Esierloh *NO REALLY YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS PRESENTATION*:
    "Math for Game Programmers: Fast and Funky 1D Nonlinear Transformations" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr5xkf6zSzk)
  * [API] CTAG files now ship with releases. This will let you quickly
    see the APIs available in DragonRuby GTK.
  * [Sample] Added a "prerequisite" sample app that gives you a crash
    course of Ruby the programming language.
  * [Sample] The composition of primitives in DragonRuby GTK are
    incredibly flexible. A sample app called "Fluid Primitives" has
    been added to show this flexibility.
  * [MacOS] [Linux] [Windows] If your screen resolution is below 720p,
    the game will start at a smaller (but still aspect-correct) resolution.
  * [Sample] Sample added showing `intersects_rect?` collision
    tolerances as a topdown level (similar to what's
    in Zelda for the NES).

= release-20190516 =

  * [Community] A big thank you to Nick Culbertson (@mobypixel) for
    creating the art and music for these games.
  * [HTML5] [Demo] [Experimental] Experimental deployment to HTML5 added. You can
    play the HTML5 version here: (https://dragonruby.itch.io/flappydragon).
  * [HTML5] `dragonruby-httpd` binary added so that you can test your
    HTML5 game locally.
  * [RaspberryPI] [Video] [Experimental] Experimental support added to Rasberry Pi. You can
    play DragonRuby GTK games, _develop them and publish them_.
    Here's a video of Ryan playing Flappy Dragon on his DIY Arcade
    Machine: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCvFMKsvG-Q).
  * [API] Mouse movement can now be tracked: `args,inputs.mouse.position`.
  * [API] Experimental API added for taking screenshots: `args.dragon.root.take_screenshot = true`.
  * [API] Analog support for controllers added: `args.inputs.controller_one.left_analog_x_perc`.
  * [API] [Experimental] Mouse and keyboard focus status are available for use:
    ```
    args.dragon.root.mouse_focus
    args.dragon.root.keyboard_focus
    ```
  * [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to use mouse position.
  * [Samples] Flappy Dragon reference implementation significantly polished.
  * [Samples] [Demo] Added BASIC Gorillas reference implementation. Playable
    here: (https://dragonruby.itch.io/basicgorillas).
  * [Samples] Added sample app that shows analog controller support in
    action. The sample also shows how to manipulate a sprite's
    center of rotation, crop, and horizontal/vertical orientation:
    ```
    [
      x, y, w, h, # decimal values (scales implicitly)
      path, # string
      angle, # in degrees
      a, # alpha (0 to 255)
      r, g, b, # color *saturation*
      source_x, source_y, source_w, source_h, (crop, must be given in original pixels)
      flip_h, flip_v, (boolean values)
      rotation_anchor_x, rotation_anchor_y (decimal between 0 and 1/ratio from bottom left)
    ]
    ```
  * [API] Added `args.dragon.calcstringbox(str, size_enum, font)`
    function that can be used to calculate the `rect` for a string.

= release-20190427 =

  * [Packaging] [Windows] Packaging Windows builds of your game now sets a proper icon and
    metadata in the final .exe.
  * [API] Keyboard input is improved dramatically, so you can get reasonable
    key state in your game.
  * [Packaging] You can now specify an application icon in your game_metadata.txt
    file instead of possibly having a second copy of the same file in
    metadata/icon.png.
  * [Sample] [Video] [Demo] Added a full-blown game/reference implementation called
    `flappy_dragon` under the `samples` directory. Here's a quick five
    second video showing the game in action:
    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQYRlVA1ru0). You can play it
    yourself here: (https://dragonruby.itch.io/flappydragon).

    `notepad.exe`.
  * [Packaging] Default icon added to `mygame`.
  * [Samples] Reworked `doomwipe` (render targets tech demo) sample app so that
    it's less erratic before the effect is revealed.
  * [Windows] Fixed bug where rendering would stop on Windows if the screen was
    resized.
  * [Size] Deleted files that don't need to be packaged with DragonRuby GTK.
